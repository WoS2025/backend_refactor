AB As a promising method for central model training on decentralized device data without compromising user privacy, federated learning (FL) is becoming more and more popular in Internet-of-Things (IoT) design. However, due to limited computing and memory resources of devices that restrict the capabilities of hosted deep learning models, existing FL approaches for artificial intelligence IoT (AIoT) applications suffer from inaccurate prediction results. To address this problem, this article presents a collaborative Big.Little branch architecture to enable efficient FL for AIoT applications. Inspired by the architecture of BranchyNet which has multiple prediction branches, our approach deploys deep neural network (DNN) models across both cloud and AIoT devices. Our Big.Little branch model has two branches, where the big branch is deployed on cloud for strengthened prediction accuracy, and the little branches are used to fit for AIoT devices. When AIoT devices cannot make the prediction with high confidence using local little branches, they will resort to the big branch for further inference. To increase both prediction accuracy and early exit rate of Big.Little branch model, we propose a two-stage training and coinference scheme, which considers the local characteristics of AIoT scenarios. Comprehensive experiment results obtained from a real AIoT environment demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in terms of prediction accuracy and average inference time.

AB Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning framework that can deal with the distributed issue in machine learning and still guarantee high learning performance. However, it is impractical that all users will sacrifice their resources to join the FL algorithm. This motivates us to study the incentive mechanism design for FL. In this paper, we consider a FL system that involves one base station (BS) and multiple mobile users. The mobile users use their own data to train the local machine learning model, and then send the trained models to the BS, which generates the initial model, collects local models and constructs the global model. Then, we formulate the incentive mechanism between the BS and mobile users as an auction game where the BS is an auctioneer and the mobile users are the sellers. In the proposed game, each mobile user submits its bids according to the minimal energy cost that the mobile users experiences in participating in FL. To decide winners in the auction and maximize social welfare, we propose the primal-dual greedy auction mechanism. The proposed mechanism can guarantee three economic properties, namely, truthfulness, individual rationality and efficiency. Finally, numerical results are shown to demonstrate the performance effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.

TI Federated Learning for Condition Monitoring of Industrial Processes: A
   Review on Fault Diagnosis Methods, Challenges, and Prospects

DE condition monitoring; fault detection; fault diagnosis; federated

ID CLASSIFICATION; PRIVACY
AB Condition monitoring (CM) of industrial processes is essential for reducing downtime and increasing productivity through accurate Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) scheduling. Indeed, advanced intelligent learning systems for Fault Diagnosis (FD) make it possible to effectively isolate and identify the origins of faults. Proven smart industrial infrastructure technology enables FD to be a fully decentralized distributed computing task. To this end, such distribution among different regions/institutions, often subject to so-called data islanding, is limited to privacy, security risks, and industry competition due to the limitation of legal regulations or conflicts of interest. Therefore, Federated Learning (FL) is considered an efficient process of separating data from multiple participants to collaboratively train an intelligent and reliable FD model. As no comprehensive study has been introduced on this subject to date, as far as we know, such a review-based study is urgently needed. Within this scope, our work is devoted to reviewing recent advances in FL applications for process diagnostics, while FD methods, challenges, and future prospects are given special attention.

AB The recent expansion of the IoT ecosystem has not only significantly increased connectivity but also introduced new security challenges. To address emerging security challenges, this study proposes a framework that merges the decentralized methodologies of federated learning (FL) and Blockchain. The framework is rigorously tested and validated on the N-BaIoT Dataset employing dense neural networks (DNNs) and logistic regression (LR). This approach decentralizes the training of machine learning (ML) models by distributing the process across individual IoT devices, this enhances the security and privacy of data. The use of Blockchain ensures transparent and secure management of these decentralized models, adding an extra layer of protection against tampering. In addition, this research introduces two novel metrics, namely the Security Efficacy Metric and the Comparative Improvement Factor, which provide a quantitative foundation for evaluating the performance of the proposed framework. The examination of the proposed framework through LR and DNNs demonstrates significant results. The LR model achieved a global accuracy of 99.98%, with an average client data size of 440.95 MB and a model size of 0.00088 MB. Meanwhile, the DNN model exhibited a global accuracy of 99.99%, with an average client data size of 551.95 MB and a model size of 0.09 MB. This research contributes to IoT security by integrating LR and DNNs within the FL setup, complemented by blockchain technology, signifying a substantial advancement in the dynamic IoT ecosystem.

AB Mobile-edge computing (MEC) has been envisioned as a promising paradigm to handle the massive volume of data generated from ubiquitous mobile devices for enabling intelligent services with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques often require centralized data collection and training in a single entity, e.g., an MEC server, which is now becoming a weak point due to data privacy concerns and high overhead of raw data communications. In this context, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to provide collaborative data training solutions, by coordinating multiple mobile devices to train a shared AI model without directly exposing their underlying data, which enjoys considerable privacy enhancement. To improve the security and scalability of FL implementation, blockchain as a ledger technology is attractive for realizing decentralized FL training without the need for any central server. Particularly, the integration of FL and blockchain leads to a new paradigm, called FLchain, which potentially transforms intelligent MEC networks into decentralized, secure, and privacy-enhancing systems. This article presents an overview of the fundamental concepts and explores the opportunities of FLchain in MEC networks. We identify several main issues in FLchain design, including communication cost, resource allocation, incentive mechanism, security and privacy protection. The key solutions and the lessons learned along with the outlooks are also discussed. Then, we investigate the applications of FLchain in popular MEC domains, such as edge data sharing, edge content caching and edge crowdsensing. Finally, important research challenges and future directions are also highlighted.

AB Federated learning (FL) has achieved state-of-the-art performance in distributed learning tasks with privacy requirements. However, it has been discovered that FL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The typical gradient inversion attacks primarily focus on attempting to obtain the client's private input in a white-box manner, where the adversary is assumed to be either the client or the server. However, if both the clients and the server are honest and fully trusted, is the FL secure? In this paper, we propose a novel method called External Gradient Inversion Attack (EGIA) in the grey-box settings. Specifically, we concentrate on the point that public-shared gradients in FL are always transmitted through the intermediary nodes, which has been widely ignored. On this basis, we demonstrate that an external adversary can reconstruct the private input using gradients even if both the clients and the server are honest and fully trusted. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the black-box attack scenario in which the adversary has only the gradients. We perform extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets to test the effectiveness of EGIA. The outcomes of our experiments validate that the EGIA method is highly effective.

AB Along with the increasing popularity of deep learning (DL) techniques, more and more Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) systems are adopting federated learning (FL) to enable privacy-aware collaborative learning among the AIoT devices. However, due to the inherent data and device heterogeneity issues, the existing FL-based AIoT systems suffer from the model selection problem. Although various heterogeneous FL methods have been investigated to enable collaborative training among the heterogeneous models, there is still a lack of 1) wise heterogeneous model generation methods for the devices; 2) consideration of uncertain factors; and 3) performance guarantee for the large models, thus strongly limiting the overall FL performance. To address the above issues, this article introduces a novel heterogeneous FL framework named FlexFL. By adopting our average percentage of zeros (APoZ)-guided flexible pruning strategy, FlexFL can effectively derive best-fit models for the heterogeneous devices to explore their greatest potential. Meanwhile, our proposed adaptive local pruning strategy allows the AIoT devices to prune their received models according to their varying resources within uncertain scenarios. Moreover, based on the self-knowledge distillation, FlexFL can enhance the inference performance of the large models by learning the knowledge from the small models. Comprehensive experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art heterogeneous FL methods, FlexFL can significantly improve the overall inference accuracy by up to 14.24%.

AB The integration of federated learning, attention-based models like BERT, and blockchain technology presents a transformative approach for managing medical records. This paper introduces a hybrid framework combining the latter technologies to solve critical challenges pertaining to the secure management of healthcare data. Federated learning provides a distributed learning of machine models, where sensitive patient data does not need to be transferred, while BERT models improve the precision in processing medical records using natural language understanding. Blockchain adds a layer of security by recording model updates transparently to ensure tamper-proofing and transactions. A concrete methodology for the implementation of the introduced framework including the design of the smart contract in Solidity is provided to secure recording the model updates. Various tests assessing the performance of the proposed system show a significant improvement in data privacy, model security and precision, compared to the other systems. This hybrid methodology offers advances in handling medical records and elaborates a new benchmark in integrating AI and blockchain for healthcare. This framework thus redefines secure and collaborative healthcare data management, setting the stage for further enhancements in privacy-focused AI applications in medical contexts.

AB This paper introduces the Ulimisana Optimisation Algorithm enabled Population Based Training (PBT-UOA) framework which allows for hyperparameters to be fine-tuned using a population based meta-heuristic algorithm at the same time as parameters are being optimised. Models are trained until near-convergence on the updated hyperparameters and the parameters of the best performing model are shared to warm start the other mod-els in the next hyperparameter tuning iteration. In the PBT-UOA, all models are trained using the same dataset. This framework performed better than the Bayesian Optimisation algorithm. This paper also introduces the Ulimisana Optimisation Algorithm enabled Federated Learning (FL-UOA) framework which is an extension of the PBT-UOA. This framework is introduced to address the challenges of scattered datasets and privacy that is presented by the increase in connected end-devices. The FL-UOA learns on local data in scattered end-devices without sending datasets to a central server. The training datasets in local end-devices are used to evaluate models trained in other end -devices. The performance metrics are used to update the Social Trust Network (STN) of the FL-UOA framework. The FL-UOA outperformed the classic Federated Learning frame-work. This STN updating technique was tested in Machine Learning (ML) Unfairness to see how well it functioned as a regularisation term. This was achieved by training different models on subsets that contained datasets representing only specific sensitive groups. Results showed that by updating the hyperparameters while learning the parameters on the dataset scattered across different devices, the FL-UOA, takes advantage of diversified learning and reduces the ML Unfairness for models trained on group specific datasets.

AB Federated learning (FL) is an attractive industrial paradigm to accomplish distributed artificial intelligence (AI) training collaboratively in a data privacy-preserving manner. Most existing designs for FL systems assume that industrial user equipments (UEs) participate voluntarily in FL training. However, since both AI model training and transmission consume considerable energy, UEs are reluctant to participate without economic rewards. Hence, the lack of proper economic reward incentive mechanism results in low UE utility and frustrates UEs' enthusiasm for participating in training. To address the above challenge, in this article, we propose a two-phase energy-aware reward incentive mechanism for the edge-cloud-assisted hierarchical federated learning (HFL) system to optimize the overall UE utility, thereby, incentivizing UEs to participate more actively. Specifically, at the cloud server phase, we design an energy quantity-aware incentive mechanism for reasonably distributing rewards to its sub-edge-assisted FL systems. Subsequently, at the edge server phase, based on the quantitative analysis for the optimal reward allocation solution, we develop an energy-aware water filling-based reward incentive mechanism to adapt to individual needs of UEs and maximize the overall UE utility. Experiments verify that, compared to well-known benchmarks, our incentive mechanism can improve the overall UE utility by up to 55.94% and better incentivize UEs to participate in training.

AB Supply Chain Financing (SCF) is increasingly utilised as an effective method for optimising cash flows in supply networks. With increased popularity several financial institutions have begun offering SCF to businesses. However various recent scandals have highlighted inefficiencies in the evaluation of risks involved. In this paper we argue this is due to a mismatch between the firm-level features used to evaluate risk and what SCF is given for, which is a particular order. However order-level risk evaluation is difficult as companies do not wish to share their datasets with funders. Furthermore, Small-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) themselves may not have enough data to conduct order-level risk evaluation. We propose a Federated Learning (FL) framework to overcome these issues, opening up the possibility for order-level risk evaluation. FL allows collective, order level model training whilst preserving privacy of data owners. A case study in the aerospace industry indicates that FL can be applied to predict buyers' late payment risk with minimal performance loss.

AB Electronic healthcare (e-healthcare) system has brought great convenience for people to seek medical treatment. However, data security, user privacy and online diagnosis efficiency have also aroused widespread public concern. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving online diagnosis scheme for e-healthcare system based on federated learning mechanism (FLM). Specifically, we first transform the data owner's data sharing problem into machine learning problem through using FLM. By sharing calculated local model parameters instead of actual data, the privacy of training data sets can be well protected. Then, we use a homomorphic cryptosystem and the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to classify patients' physiological data efficiently without leaking their privacy. Furthermore, we design a novel approach to recover decision function of SVM model, which can efficiently prevent model parameters from leaking. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can protect data privacy under the defined threat models. Numerical results derived from experiments show that the proposed scheme is highly efficient. Therefore, our scheme is of practical significance in the e-healthcare system.

AB Data-driven industrial health prognostics require rich training data to develop accurate and reliable predictive models. However, stringent data privacy laws and the abundance of edge industrial data necessitate decentralized data utilization. Thus, the industrial health prognostics field is well suited to significantly benefit from federated learning (FL), a decentralized and privacy-preserving learning technique. However, FL-based health prognostics tasks have hardly been investigated due to the complexities of meaningfully aggregating model parameters trained from heterogeneous data to form a high performing federated model. Specifically, data heterogeneity among edge devices, stemming from dissimilar degradation mechanisms and unequal dataset sizes, poses a critical statistical challenge for developing accurate federated models. We propose a pioneering FL-based health prognostic model with a feature similarity-matched parameter aggregation algorithm to discriminatingly learn from heterogeneous edge data. The algorithm searches across the heterogeneous locally trained models and matches neurons with probabilistically similar feature extraction functions first, before selectively averaging them to form the federated model parameters. As the algorithm only averages similar neurons, as opposed to conventional naive averaging of coordinate-wise neurons, the distinct feature extractors of local models are carried over with less dilution to the resultant federated model. Using both cyclic degradation data of Li-ion batteries and non-cyclic data of turbofan engines, we demonstrate that the proposed method yields accuracy improvements as high as 44.5% and 39.3% for state-of-health estimation and remaining useful life estimation, respectively. Note to Practitioners-Data-driven machine health monitoring enabled by cyber-physical systems allows humans to make timely predictive maintenance decisions for optimizing the life cycle of critical industrial assets. However, the benefits of intelligent health prognostics may not be fully realized in practice because strict data privacy laws restrict the aggregation of decentralized industrial data that are essential for model training. In proposing a privacy-preserving learning technique, we also focused on tackling a common and practical problem of learning from heterogeneous degradation data at the edge. The competitive performance of the proposed similarity-matching-based federated learning algorithm indicates its suitability for modeling heterogeneous, industrial time series data. Therefore, industry practitioners can utilize this algorithm as a staple component of their machine health modeling toolkit in an increasingly privacy-concerned era.

AB The current 5G and conceived 6G era with ultra -high density, ultra -high frequency bandwidth, and ultra -low latency can support emerging applications like Extended Reality (XR), Vehicle to Everything (V2X), and massive Internet of Things (IoT). With the rapid growth of transmission rate requirements and link numbers in the wireless communication network, how to allocate resources reasonably and further improve spectrum utilization challenges the traditional approaches. To address these problems, technologies such as device -to -device (D2D) communication and machine learning (ML) are introduced to the traditional cellular communication network to improve network performance. However, due to the interference caused by spectrum reusing, efficient resource allocation for both cellular users and D2D users is necessary. In this article, we consider underlay mode D2D-enabled wireless network to improve the spectrum utilization, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based federated learning (FL) -aided decentralized resource allocation approach to maximize the sum capacity and minimize the overall power consumption while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) requirement of both cellular users and D2D users. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated through simulations under 5G millimeter -wave (mm -wave) and 6G terahertz (THz) scenarios separately. The simulation results show that the proposal achieves significant network performance compared with the baseline algorithms.

AB With the explosive growth of smart mobile devices in wireless networks, the increasing computational power of mobile chips and the growing concern for personal privacy, a decentralized deep learning framework at the mobile terminal layer has emerged called federated learning (FL) to enhance user experience. This paper studies the training efficiency optimization problem of wireless FL that jointly considers processor performance, channel conditions and terminals' power in a non-independent identically distribution (non-IID) scenario. And, the training efficiency optimization problem is mathematically modeled and then decomposed into several sub-problems based on the independence and decoupling of the variables involved. To enhance the training efficiency of wireless FL, a comprehensive scheduling strategy encompassing computational and communication aspects is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed scheduling strategy for wireless FL achieves superior learning performance with reduced training latency.

AB Although data-driven methods usually have noticeable performance on disease diagnosis and treatment, they are suspected of leakage of privacy due to collecting data for model training. Recently, federated learning provides a secure and trustable alternative to collaboratively train model without any exchange of medical data among multiple institutes. Therefore, it has draw much attention due to its natural merit on privacy protection. However, when heterogenous medical data exists between different hospitals, federated learning usually has to face with degradation of performance. In the paper, we propose a new personalized framework of federated learning to handle the problem. It successfully yields personalized models based on awareness of similarity between local data, and achieves better tradeoff between generalization and personalization than existing methods. After that, we further design a differentially sparse regularizer to improve communication efficiency during procedure of model training. Additionally, we propose an effective method to reduce the computational cost, which improves computation efficiency significantly. Furthermore, we collect five real medical datasets, including two public medical image datasets and three private multi-center clinical diagnosis datasets, and evaluate its performance by conducting nodule classification, tumor segmentation, and clinical risk prediction tasks. Comparing with 14 existing related methods, the proposed method successfully achieves the best model performance, and meanwhile up to 60% improvement of communication efficiency.

AB Nowadays, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has played an integral role in Industry 4.0 and produced massive amounts of data for industrial intelligence. These data locate on decentralized devices in modern factories. To protect the confidentiality of industrial data, federated learning (FL) was introduced to collaboratively train shared machine learning (ML) models. However, the local data collected by different devices skew in class distribution and degrade industrial FL performance. This challenge has been widely studied at the mobile edge, but they ignored the rapidly changing streaming data and clustering nature of factory devices, and more seriously, they may threaten data security. In this article, we propose FEDGS, which is a hierarchical cloud-edge-end FL framework for 5G empowered industries, to improve industrial FL performance on non-independent and identically distributed (non-j) data. Taking advantage of naturally clustered factory devices, FEDGS uses a gradient-based binary permutation algorithm (GBP-CS) to select a subset of devices within each factory and build homogeneous super nodes participating in FL training. Then, we propose a compound-step synchronization protocol to coordinate the training process within and among these super nodes, which shows great robustness against data heterogeneity. The proposed methods are time-efficient and can adapt to dynamic environments, without exposing confidential industrial data in risky manipulation. We prove that FEDGS has better convergence performance than FedAvg and give a relaxed condition under which FEDGS is more communication efficient. The extensive experiments show that FEDGS improves accuracy by 3.5% and reduces training rounds by 59% on average, confirming its superior effectiveness and efficiency on non-i.i.d. data.

ID DESIGN
AB As a distributed machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) enables participating clients to share only model gradients instead of local data and achieves the secure sharing of private data. However, the lack of clients' willingness to participate in FL and the malicious influence of unreliable clients both seriously degrade the performance of FL. The current research on the incentive mechanism of FL lacks the accurate assessment of clients' truthfulness and reliability, and the incentive mechanism based on untruthful and unreliable clients is unreliable and inefficient. To solve this problem, we propose an incentive mechanism based on the reputation mechanism and reverse auction to achieve a more truthful, more reliable, and more efficient FL. First, we introduce the reputation mechanism to measure clients' truthfulness and reliability through multiple reputation evaluations and design a reliable client selection scheme. Then the reverse auction is introduced to select the optimal clients that maximize the social surplus while satisfying individual rationality, incentive compatibility, and weak budget balance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that this incentive mechanism can motivate more clients with high-quality data and high reputations to participate in FL with less cost, which increases the FL tasks' economic benefit by 31% and improves the accuracy from 0.9356 to 0.9813, and then promote the efficient and stable development of the FL service trading market.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Federated learning (FL) empowers distributed clients to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model through exchanging parameter information. Despite the fact that FL can protect clients' raw data, malicious users can still crack original data with disclosed parameters. To amend this flaw, differential privacy (DP) is incorporated into FL clients to disturb original parameters, which however can significantly impair the accuracy of the trained model. In this work, we study an imperative question which has been vastly overlooked by existing works: what are the optimal numbers of queries and replies in FL with DP so that the final model accuracy is maximized. In FL, the parameter server (PS) needs to query participating clients for multiple global iterations to complete training. Each client responds a query from the PS by conducting a local iteration. We consider FL that will uniformly and randomly select participating clients to conduct local iterations with the FedSGD algorithm. Our work investigates how many times the PS should query clients and how many times each client should reply the PS by incorporating two most extensively used DP mechanisms (i.e., the Laplace mechanism and Gaussian mechanisms). Through conducting convergence rate analysis, we can determine the optimal numbers of queries and replies in FL with DP so that the final model accuracy can be maximized. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted with publicly available datasets: MNIST and FEMNIST, to verify our analysis and the results demonstrate that properly setting the numbers of queries and replies can significantly improve the final model accuracy in FL with DP.

AB Federated learning is a distributed machine learning technology that can protect users' data privacy, so it has attracted more and more attention in the industry and academia. Nonetheless, most of the existing works focused on the cost optimization of the entire process, while the cost of individual participants cannot be considered. In this article, we explore a min-max cost-optimal problem to guarantee the convergence rate of federated learning in terms of cost in wireless edge networks. In particular, we minimize the cost of the worst-case participant subject to the delay, local CPU-cycle frequency, power allocation, local accuracy, and subcarrier assignment constraints. Considering that the formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we decompose it into several sub-problems to derive its solutions, in which the subcarrier assignment and power allocation are obtained by utilizing the Lagrangian dual decomposition method, the CPU-cycle frequency is obtained by a heuristic algorithm, and the local accuracy is obtained by an iteration algorithm. Simulation results show the convergence of the proposed algorithm and reveal that the proposed scheme can accomplish a tradeoff between the cost and fairness by comparing the proposed scheme with the existing schemes.

AB Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still a threat to global health and safety, and it is anticipated that deep learning (DL) will be the most effective way of detecting COVID-19 and other chest diseases such as lung cancer (LC), tuberculosis (TB), pneumothorax (PneuTh), and pneumonia (Pneu). However, data sharing across hospitals is hampered by patients' right to privacy, leading to unexpected results from deep neural network (DNN) models. Federated learning (FL) is a game-changing concept since it allows clients to train models together without sharing their source data with anybody else. Few studies, however, focus on improving the model's accuracy and stability, whereas most existing FL-based COVID-19 detection techniques aim to maximize secondary objectives such as latency, energy usage, and privacy. In this work, we design a novel model named decision-making-based federated learning network (DMFL_Net) for medical diagnostic image analysis to distinguish COVID-19 from four distinct chest disorders including LC, TB, PneuTh, and Pneu. The DMFL_Net model that has been suggested gathers data from a variety of hospitals, constructs the model using the DenseNet-169, and produces accurate predictions from information that is kept secure and only released to authorized individuals. Extensive experiments were carried out with chest X-rays (CXR), and the performance of the proposed model was compared with two transfer learning (TL) models, i.e., VGG-19 and VGG-16 in terms of accuracy (ACC), precision (PRE), recall (REC), specificity (SPF), and F1-measure. Additionally, the DMFL_Net model is also compared with the default FL configurations. The proposed DMFL_Net + DenseNet-169 model achieves an accuracy of 98.45% and outperforms other approaches in classifying COVID-19 from four chest diseases and successfully protects the privacy of the data among diverse clients.

AB Federated learning (FL) has been an effective way to train a machine learning model distributedly, holding local data without exchanging them. However, due to the inaccessibility of local data, FL with label noise would be more challenging. Most existing methods assume only open-set or closed-set noise and correspondingly propose filtering or correction solutions, ignoring that label noise can be mixed in real-world scenarios. In this article, we propose a novel FL method to discriminate the type of noise and make the FL mixed noise-robust, named FedMIN. FedMIN employs a composite framework that captures local-global differences in multiparticipant distributions to model generalized noise patterns. By determining adaptive thresholds for identifying mixed label noise in each client and assigning appropriate weights during model aggregation, FedMIN enhances the performance of the global model. Furthermore, FedMIN incorporates a loss alignment mechanism using local and global Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to mitigate the risk of revealing samplewise loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on several public datasets, which include the simulated FL testbeds, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, and the real-world ones, i.e., Camelyon17 and multiorgan nuclei challenge (MoNuSAC). Compared to FL benchmarks, FedMIN improves model accuracy by up to 9.9% due to its superior noise estimation capabilities.

AB Digital twin edge networks provide a new paradigm that combines mobile edge computing (MEC) and digital twins to improve network performance and reduce communication cost by utilizing digital twin models of physical objects. The construction of digital twin models requires powerful computing ability. However, the distributed devices with limited computing resources cannot complete high-fidelity digital twin construction. Moreover, weak communication links between these devices may hinder the potential of digital twins. To address these issues, we propose a two-layer digital twin edge network, in which the physical network layer offloads training tasks using passive reflecting links, and the digital twin layer establishes a digital twin model to record the dynamic states of physical components. We then formulate a system cost minimization problem to jointly optimize task offloading, configurations of passive reflecting links, and computing resources. Finally, we design a federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme to solve the problem, where local agents train offloading decisions and global agents optimize the allocation of edge computing resources and configurations of passive reflecting elements. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed federated DRL and it can reduce the system cost by up to 67.1% compared to the benchmarks.

ID LEARNING FRAMEWORK
AB Federated learning breaks down data silos and promotes the intelligence of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, the principal-agent architecture commonly used in federated learning not only increases the cost but also fails to take into account the privacy protection and trustworthiness of flexible on-demand data sharing. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a secure and trusted federated data sharing (STFS) based on blockchain. Initially, we construct an autonomous and reliable federated extreme gradient boosting learning algorithm to crack the data isolation problem, providing privacy protection and verifiability. Furthermore, we design a secure and trusted data sharing and trading mechanism to ensure secure on-demand controlled data sharing and fair trading. Finally, the security of STFS is proved based on the universal composable theory. The results of ample experimental simulations demonstrate the good effectiveness and performance of STFS for IIoT applications.

AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) driven by 5G cellular systems has recently emerged as a promising paradigm, enabling mobile devices (MDs) with limited computing resources to offload various computation-intensive tasks (such as autopilot, online game) to edge servers to enhance the data processing capabilities of MDs. However, the uncertainty of wireless channel state and data volume of offloading tasks, as well as the data security privacy of offloading tasks, bring serious challenges to computation offloading in MEC. In this article, we consider a time-varying MEC scenario and formalize the delay and energy consumption during the computation offloading process as a joint optimization problem. Then the optimization problem is decomposed into two sub-problems: intelligent task prediction and resource allocation. Different from traditional methods, we improve the federated learning (FL) algorithm and propose a thoughtful cloud-edge-client FL task prediction mechanism based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory. Each participating MD trains the model locally without uploading data to the server, and periodically aggregates the model in the edge and in the cloud. The algorithm both eliminates the need to solve complex optimization problems and ensures user privacy security. Finally, experimental results show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms other benchmark algorithms in energy efficiency.

We first develop cooperative federated learning through an access point (AP) to help resource-limited smart devices in constructing digital twin at the network edges belonging to different mobile network operators (MNOs). Then, we propose a model update chain by leveraging directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain to secure both local model updates and global model updates. In order to incentivize the APs to help in local models training for resource-limited smart devices and also encourage the APs to contribute resource in local model update verification, we design an iterative double auction-based joint cooperative federated learning and local model update verification scheme. The optimal unified time for cooperative federated learning and local model update verification is solved to maximize social welfare. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme is efficient in digital twin construction.

AB The integration of blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT) is seen as having significant potential. In IoT Environments, Blockchain builds a trusted environment for IoT information sharing, where information is immutable and reliable. In particular, when edge devices are connected to a blockchain network, they need to be connected to reliable blockchain peers for synchronizing with valid data. Therefore, blockchain reliability prediction has gained attention owing to its ability to help users find highly reliable blockchain peers. Contextual information has been considered useful in many studies for generating highly personalized blockchain reliability predictions. However, these contextual factors are privacy-sensitive, and therefore disclosing them to third parties is risky. To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving personalized blockchain reliability prediction model through federated learning neural collaborative filtering (FNCF) in IoT. Our model allows users to achieve user privacy protection without passing data to a third party and provides personalized predictions for users. We can also leverage the power of edge computing to enable a fast data processing capability and low latency required by IoT applications. Finally, our model was evaluated using a set of experiments based on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves high accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.

AB Edge-based technologies have emerged as a key enabler to empower low-latency services and incorporate machine learning techniques for learning/inference. However, transferring user data to the edge server to conduct learning could violate data privacy and overburden the network. In addition, the server could receive multiple redundant tasks for inference which leads to redundant computations. In this article, we study both communication and computation issues in edge networks by emphasizing data privacy in a smart home scenario. We design an architecture that incorporates federated edge learning to promote data privacy and a node weighting and dropping scheme to select the appropriate participating devices with quality data and therefore improve the training and reduce communication cost. We further apply Long Short-Term Memory to predict future tasks and proactively store them locally at the edge device. We adopt the computation reuse concept to satisfy incoming tasks with less-to-no computation and thus eliminating redundant computation and further decreasing the computation cost. Simulation results based on real-world dataset show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture. The training phase is reached with few iterations, while computation and communication are reduced by up to 80% and 70%, respectively, compared with existing schemes while data privacy is promoted.

AB Motivated by Industry 4.0, 5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; also known as drones) are widely applied in various industries. However, the open nature of 5G networks threatens the safe sharing of data. In particular, privacy leakage can lead to serious losses for users. As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) avoids privacy leakage by allowing data models to be shared instead of raw data. Unfortunately, the traditional FL framework is strongly dependent on a centralized aggregation server, which will cause the system to crash if the server is compromised. Unauthorized participants may launch poisoning attacks, thereby reducing the usability of models. In addition, communication barriers hinder collaboration among a large number of cross-domain devices for learning. To address the abovementioned issues, a blockchain-empowered decentralized horizontal FL framework is proposed. The authentication of cross-domain UAVs is accomplished through multisignature smart contracts. Global model updates are computed by using these smart contracts instead of a centralized server. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves high efficiency of cross-domain authentication and good accuracy.

AB Machine learning (ML) tasks are becoming ubiquitous in today's network applications. Federated learning has emerged recently as a technique for training ML models at the network edge by leveraging processing capabilities across the nodes that collect the data. There are several challenges with employing conventional federated learning in contemporary networks, due to the significant heterogeneity in compute and communication capabilities that exist across devices. To address this, we advocate a new learning paradigm called fog learning, which will intelligently distribute ML model training across the continuum of nodes from edge devices to cloud servers. Fog learning enhances federated learning along three major dimensions: network, heterogeneity, and proximity. It considers a multi-layer hybrid learning framework consisting of heterogeneous devices with various proximities. It accounts for the topology structures of the local networks among the heterogeneous nodes at each network layer, orchestrating them for collaborative/cooperative learning through device-to-device communications. This migrates from star network topologies used for parameter transfers in federated learning to more distributed topologies at scale. We discuss several open research directions toward realizing fog learning.

AB Public health emergencies have brought great challenges to the stability of the e-commerce supply chain. Demand forecasting is a key driver for the sound development of e-commerce enterprises. To prevent the potential privacy leakage of e-commerce enterprises in the process of demand forecasting using multi-party data, and to improve the accuracy of demand forecasting models, we propose an e-commerce enterprise demand forecasting method based on Horizontal Federated Learning and ConvLSTM, from the perspective of sustainable development. First, in view of the shortcomings of traditional RNN and LSTM demand forecasting models, which cannot handle multi-dimensional time-series problems, we propose a demand forecasting model based on ConvLSTM. Secondly, to address the problem that data cannot be directly shared and exchanged between e-commerce enterprises of the same type, the goal of demand information sharing modeling is realized indirectly through Horizontal Federated Learning. Experimental results on a large number of real data sets show that, compared with benchmark experiments, our proposed method can improve the accuracy of e-commerce enterprise demand forecasting models while avoiding privacy data leakage, and the bullwhip effect value is closer to 1. Therefore, we effectively alleviate the bullwhip effect of the entire supply chain system in demand forecasting, and promote the sustainable development of e-commerce companies.

AB Federated learning (FL) enables distributed joint training of machine learning (ML) models without the need to share local data. FL is, however, not immune to privacy threats such as model inversion (MI) attacks. The conventional FL paradigm often uses privacy-preserving techniques, and this could lead to a considerable loss in the model's utility and consequently compromised by MI attackers. Seeking to address this limitation, this paper proposes a robust variational encoder-based personalised FL (RVE-PFL) approach that mitigates MI attacks, preserves model utility, and ensures data privacy. RVE-PFL comprises an innovative personalised variational encoder architecture and a trustworthy threat model-integrated FL method to autonomously preserve data privacy, and mitigate MI attacks. The proposed architecture seamlessly trains heterogeneous data at every client, while the proposed approach aggregates data at the server side and effectively discriminates against adversarial settings (i.e., MI); thus, achieving robustness and trustworthiness in real-time. RVE-PFL is evaluated on three benchmark datasets, namely: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Cifar-10. The experimental results revealed that RVE-PFL achieves high accuracy level while preserving data and tuning adversarial settings. It outperforms Noising before Model Aggregation FL (NbAFL) with significant accuracy improvements of 8%, 20%, and 59% on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Cifar-10, respectively. These findings reinforce the effectiveness of RVE-PFL in protecting against MI attacks while maintaining the model's utility. The source code for RVE-PFL can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/UNSW-Canberra-2023/RVE-PFL.

AB The zero Touch Management (ZSM) concept in 5G and Beyond networks (B5G) aims to automate the management and orchestration of running network slices. This requires heavy usage of advanced deep learning techniques in a closed-loop way to auto-build the suitable decisions, enabling to meet network slices' requirements. In this context, Federated Learning (FL) is playing a vital role in training deep learning models in a collaborative way among thousands of network slice participants while ensuring their privacy and hence network slice isolation. Specifically, running network slices may share only their model parameters with a central entity, e.g., Inter Domain Slice Manager, to aggregate them and build a global model. Thus, the central entity does not directly access the training data. However, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where an insider participant may upload poisoning updates to the central entity so that it can cause a construction failure of the global model and thus affect its global performance. Therefore, it is crucial to design security means to detect and mitigate such threats. In this paper, we design a novel framework to automatically detect malicious participants in the FL process. In particular, our framework first uses a deep reinforcement algorithm to dynamically select a network slice as a trusted participant, based mainly on its reputation. The selected participant will then be in charge of identifying poisoning model updates by leveraging unsupervised machine learning. We demonstrate the feasibility of our framework on top of a real dataset that we generate using the 5G OpenAirInterface (OAI) platform. Evaluation results show the efficiency of our framework in dealing with poisoning attacks even with the presence of several malicious participants.

AB With the technologies of wireless mobile networks and wireless devices, users have faced a severe issue of data overload in application usage. Preference recommendation of applications is viewed as an effective method to solve such issues, which mainly relies on users' interests in an application. However, preference recommendation of applications ignores what functions users like to utilize. This paper aims to address the data overload issue by analyzing users' preference of functional classes for devices in wireless mobile networks and proposes a privacy scheme of block -stream service for DEX files based on federated learning. We first propose a formalized model of application functions to provide insight into applications. We calculate correlation weights of functions in mobile applications by using users' operation behavior data. The homomorphic encryption technologies are also utilized to prevent privacy leakage of model parameters in this paper. Finally, models involved in the proposed scheme are stored in the blockchain to support trusted storage and traceability services. Experiment results are presented to verify the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. Compared with other block -streaming loading schemes, the proposed scheme in this paper has a pretty good performance in saving storage space.

AB Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks when an adversary attempts to upload poison gradients with the intent to corrupt the global model of FL. Various approaches have been proposed to counter these risks. However, it becomes challenging when one tries to preserve the privacy of FL participants and ensure robustness against data poisoning attacks. In this paper, we propose DPFLA, a novel scheme that can detect poisoning attacks without revealing the actual gradients of participants. DPFLA is a lossless aggregation scheme delicately designed for adopting masks to protect private data while extracting poisoned data features. Specifically, we first apply removable masks to the gradients outputted by each participant. Second, we aggregate the masked data and decompose them using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract specific features as well as achieve dimensionality reduction. Third, we leverage a clustering paradigm to detect poison gradients from the low dimension and eliminate them in the following training rounds. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate that DPFLA can detect poison gradients effectively. Additionally, the comparisons of case studies demonstrate that DPFLA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Federated edge learning (FEEL) is a rapidly growing distributed learning technique for next-generation wireless edge systems. Smart systems across various application domains face challenges, such as data heterogeneity, limited wireless resources, and device heterogeneity, which necessitate intelligent participant selection schemes that accelerate convergence rates. Consequently, this article presents joint participant selection and bandwidth allocation schemes to address these challenges. First, we formulate an optimization problem that considers communication and computation latencies, as well as imbalanced data distribution, while meeting round deadlines and bandwidth constraints. To address the combinatorial problems of participant selection, we employ a relaxation method followed by a proposed priority selection algorithm to select near-optimal participants. The proposed algorithm initially prioritizes participants with larger datasets, effective channel states, and better CPU speeds. To address data heterogeneity, we propose a randomized deadline-controlling algorithm that diversifies updates by allowing the edge server to include different participants with fewer data samples in training rounds. The proposed algorithms offer near-optimal performance compared to the brute-force method. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme accelerates the convergence rate by up to 55% under extensive non-IID settings compared to benchmarks. Furthermore, the deadline-controlling algorithm improves performance at high levels of data heterogeneity, resulting in faster FEEL systems.

AB Sharing data while protecting privacy in the industrial Internet is a significant challenge. Traditional machine learning methods require a combination of all data for training; however, this approach can be limited by data availability and privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) has gained considerable attention because it allows for decentralized training on multiple local datasets. However, the training data collected by data providers are often non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), resulting in poor FL performance. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving approach for sharing non-IID data in the industrial Internet using an FL approach based on blockchain technology. To overcome the problem of non-IID data leading to poor training accuracy, we propose dynamically updating the local model based on the divergence of the global and local models. This approach can significantly improve the accuracy of FL training when there is relatively large dispersion. In addition, we design a dynamic gradient clipping algorithm to alleviate the influence of noise on the model accuracy to reduce potential privacy leakage caused by sharing model parameters. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme using commonly used open-source image datasets. The simulation results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy while protecting privacy and maintaining efficiency, thereby providing a new solution to data-sharing and privacy-protection challenges in the industrial Internet.

AB The existing data repair methods primarily focus on addressing missing data issues by utilizing variational autoencoders to learn the underlying distribution and generate content that represents the missing parts, thus achieving data repair. However, this method is only applicable to data missing problems and cannot identify abnormal data. Additionally, as data privacy concerns continue to gain public attention, it poses a challenge to traditional methods. This article proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN) model based on the federated learning framework and a long shortterm memory network, namely the FedLGAN model, to achieve anomaly detection and repair of hydrological telemetry data. In this model, the discriminator in the GAN structure is employed for anomaly detection, while the generator is utilized for abnormal data repair. Furthermore, to capture the temporal features of the original data, a bidirectional long short-term memory network with an attention mechanism is embedded into the GAN. The federated learning framework avoids privacy leakage of hydrological telemetry data during the training process. Experimental results based on four real hydrological telemetry devices demonstrate that the FedLGAN model can achieve anomaly detection and repair while preserving privacy.

AB In cross-silo federated learning (FL), organizations cooperatively train a global model with their local datasets. However, some organizations may act as free riders such that they only contribute a small amount of resources but can obtain a high-accuracy global model. Meanwhile, some organizations can be business competitors, and they do not trust each other or any third-party entity. In this work, our goal is to design a framework that motivates efficient cooperation among organizations without the coordination of a central entity. To this end, we propose a blockchain-empowered incentive mechanism framework for cross-silo FL. Under this incentive mechanism framework, we develop a distributed algorithm that enables organizations to achieve social efficiency, individual rationality, and budget balance without private information of the organizations. Our proposed algorithm has a proven convergence guarantee and empirically achieves a higher convergence rate than a benchmark method. Moreover, we propose a transaction minimization algorithm to reduce the number of transactions made among organizations in the blockchain. This algorithm is proven to achieve a performance no worse than twice the minimum value. The experimental results in a testbed show that our proposed framework enables organizations to achieve social efficiency within a relatively short iterative process.

ID CHANNEL RECIPROCITY
AB Deep learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback has garnered significant research attention in recent years. However, previous research has overlooked the potential privacy disclosure problem caused by transmitting CSI datasets during the training process. In this study, we introduce a federated edge learning (FEEL)-based training framework for DL-based CSI feedback. This approach differs from the conventional centralized learning (CL)-based framework, where the CSI datasets are collected at the base station (BS) before training. Instead, each user equipment (UE) trains a local autoencoder network and exchanges model parameters with the BS. This approach provides better protection for data privacy compared to CL. To further reduce communication overhead in FEEL, we quantize the uplink and downlink model transmission into different bits based on their influence on feedback performance. Additionally, since the heterogeneity of CSI datasets among different UEs can degrade the performance of the FEEL-based framework, we introduce a personalization strategy to enhance feedback performance. This strategy allows for local fine-tuning to adapt the global model to the channel characteristics of each UE. Simulation results indicate that the proposed personalized FEEL-based training framework can significantly improve the performance of DL-based CSI feedback while reducing communication overhead.

AB Utilizing multi-modal neuroimaging data is proven to be effective in investigating human cognitive activ-ities and certain pathologies. However, it is not practical to obtain the full set of paired neuroimaging data centrally since the collection faces several constraints, e.g., high examination cost, long acquisition time, and image corruption. In addition, these data are dispersed into different medical institutions and thus cannot be aggregated for centralized training considering the privacy issues. There is a clear need to launch federated learning and facilitate the integration of dispersed data from different institutions. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark for federated domain translation on unsupervised brain image synthesis (FedMed-GAN) to bridge the gap between federated learning and medical GAN. FedMed-GAN mitigates the mode collapse without sacrificing the performance of generators, and is widely applied to different proportions of unpaired and paired data with variation adaptation properties. We treat the gradient penalties using the federated averaging algorithm and then leverage the differential privacy gra-dient descent to regularize the training dynamics. A comprehensive evaluation is provided for comparing FedMed-GAN and other centralized methods, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art.

AB The development of high-quality deep learning models demands the transfer of user data from edge devices, where it originates, to centralized servers. This central training approach has scalability limitations and poses privacy risks to private data. Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training framework that empowers physical smart systems devices to collaboratively learn a task without sharing private training data with a central server. However, FL introduces new challenges to Beyond 5G (B5G) networks, such as communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and privacy concerns, as the exchange of model updates may still lead to data leakage. This paper explores the communication overhead and privacy risks facing the implementation of FL and presents an algorithm that encompasses Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Differential Privacy (DP) techniques to address these challenges in FL. We compare the operational flow and network model of model-based and model-agnostic (KD-based) FL algorithms that enable customizing per-client model architecture to accommodate heterogeneous and constrained system resources. Our experiments show that KD-based FL algorithms are able to exceed local accuracy and achieve comparable accuracy to central training. Additionally, we show that applying DP to KD-based FL significantly damages its utility, leading to up to 70% accuracy loss for a privacy budget & varepsilon;<= 10 .

AB The aerial capabilities and flexibility in movement of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has enabled them to adaptively provide both traditional and more contemporary services. In this article, we introduce a solution that integrates the capabilities of both UAVs and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) to provide both intelligent connectivity and services to both aerial and ground connected devices. A cooperative solution is adopted that considers nodes' power and movement constraints. The UAV and UGV cooperative process ensures continuous power availability to UAVs to support seamless and continuous service availability to end-devices. A Federated Learning (FL) approach is adopted at the edge to ensure accurate and up-to-date service provisioning in accordance with the surrounding environment and network constraints. Moreover, Blockchain technology is used to decentralize the provisioning and control aspects, and ensure authenticity and integrity. Extensive simulations are conducted to test the soundness and applicability of the proposed solution. Results show significant improvement in terms of connectivity, service availability, and UAV energy enhancements when compared to traditional mobile and vehicular communication techniques.

AB With the development of Autonomous Marine Vehicles, research on real-time health monitoring based on data from remote monitoring and shore-based control center has attracted more and more attention. However, the feature extraction capability of each local client model is limited by the size and quality of data collected by remote monitoring. For clients with zero-shot, it is necessary to design an efficient federated learning framework which allows shore-based federation center with few-shot help to strengthen the feature extraction capability of clients. In this paper, a semi-supervised federated learning strategy based on adaptive learning mechanism of prototype points is proposed to solve the problem that clients with zero-shot have difficulty in establishing reliable fault diagnosis models when the quality of client data is inhomogeneous. By designing an adaptive prototypical network learning mechanism driven by sample quality and a dynamic in-and-out mechanism for local pseudo-labeled dataset, the few-shot learning capability of federation center as well as the reliability of local client's prototype points are enhanced to alleviate the impact of unreliable pseudo-label on semi-supervised learning. The experiment validation on the rolling bearing dataset provided by Case Western Reserve University can come to an accuracy increasement of 13.12%, which indicates that the proposed Adpro-SSFL outperforms existed semi-supervised federated learning method when data suffered by high missing rate due to the interference of external factors on the signal acquisition sensor.

AB This work studies federated learning (FL) over a fog radio access network, in which multiple internet-of-things (IoT) devices cooperatively learn a shared machine learning model by communicating with a cloud server (CS) through distributed access points (APs). Under the assumption that the fronthaul links connecting APs to CS have finite capacity, a rate-splitting transmission at IoT devices (IDs) is proposed which enables hybrid edge and cloud decoding of split uplink messages. The problem of completion time minimization for FL is tackled by optimizing the rate-splitting transmission and fronthaul quantization strategies along with training hyperparameters such as precision and iteration numbers. Numerical results show that the proposed rate-splitting transmission achieves notable gains over benchmark schemes which rely solely on edge or cloud decoding.

AB Federated Learning is a distributed machine learning framework, which mainly adopts cloud-edge collaborative computing mode and supports multiple participants to train models without directly sharing local data. However, participants' sensitive information may still be leaked through their gradients. Besides, incorrect aggregated results returned by the aggregation server may reduce the effect of joint modeling. This article proposes a privacy-preserving and verifiable federated learning method called PPVerifier to support privacy protection and verification of aggregated results in the cloud-edge collaborative computing environment. By the integrating Paillier homomorphic encryption and random number generation technique, all gradients and their ciphertexts can be protected. Meanwhile, an additive secret-sharing scheme is introduced to resist potential collusion attacks among the aggregation server, malicious participants, and edge nodes. Moreover, a verification scheme based on discrete logarithm is proposed, which can not only verify the correctness of aggregated results, but also discover lazy aggregation servers, and the verification overhead can be reduced by over half compared with a bilinear aggregate signature method. Finally, theoretical analysis and experiments conducted on the MNIST data set prove that our proposed method can achieve gradient protection and correctness verification of the aggregated results with higher efficiency.

AB Federated learning (FL) provides a promising way to train a machine learning model among mobile devices without collecting their raw data to a central node. During training, proper devices are selected to participate in the training process to avoid model unfairness. In a mobile edge network, participant selection must be considered together with three factors: non-iid datasets possessed by devices, tunable local iterations on devices, and radio resource allocation to counter the impact of time-varying channel conditions on parameter transmissions. Since datasets of devices are given, to ensure model fairness and achieve fast convergence in the FL training process, participants, local iterations, and radio resources must be scheduled jointly in each iteration of FL training. In this paper, the joint scheduling problem is analyzed and formulated. Since it is NP-hard, a heuristic scheduling method called PALORA is designed to conduct joint scheduling of participants, local iterations, and radio resources. PALORA consists of three sequentially interactive function blocks: 1) a pointer network embedded deep reinforcement learning method to select participants, 2) an estimation algorithm to determine the numbers of local iterations, and 3) a breadth-first search method to allocate radio resources to the selected participants. PALORA is evaluated via extensive simulations based on real-world datasets. Results show that it significantly outperforms benchmark approaches.

AB Mobile Device Cloud (MDC) has become a promising and lucrative cloud environment that exploit nearby mobile devices' idle resources to improve compute-intensive applications. Computing code at nearby mobile devices rather than a distant master cloud helps improve real-time applications' performance. However, it is non-trivial to motivate the worker devices to participate voluntarily in sharing their unused resources. In this paper, we have provided a distributed mobile device cloud environment by which workers make their auction decisions distributively and parallelly. We also introduce the federated learning and multi-weight subjective logic-based reputation scheme to measure worker mobile devices' trustworthiness and reliability. Moreover, a novel utility function for the buyers is proposed considering the cost, Quality-of-Experience (QoE), and the workers' reputation by which buyers select the most suitable worker in a distributed way. We have also proved that our proposed system achieves the desirable properties of computational efficiency, individual rationality, truthfulness, and budget balance. Empirical evaluations have been carried out in MATLAB that demonstrate the significant performance improvement in terms of QoE and utility of the buyers compared to other state-of-the-art works.

AB The current industrial scenario has witnessed the application of several artificial intelligence-based technologies for mining and processing IoMT-based big data. An emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL), has been widely applied in IoMT-based systems as a measure to overcome the issues associated with incorporating AI into such lightweight distributed computing systems while tackling privacy issues as well. However, extensive research has identified that classical FL is still prone to privacy threats due to data leakage and the chances of adversarial attacks during gradient transfer operations. Inspired by these issues, we propose a privacy-preserving framework (Fed_select) that ensures user anonymity in IoMT-based environments for big data analysis under the FL scheme. Fed_Select utilizes alternative minimization to limit gradients and participants in system training to decrease points of system vulnerability. The framework works on an edge computing-based architecture which ensures user anonymity via the employment of hybrid encryption techniques along with added benefits of load reduction at the central server. Also, a Laplacian noise-based differential privacy is employed on the shared attributes for security enhancement that adds confidentiality to the transferred data even during adversarial scenarios. Experimental results on standard datasets showcase that the change in the volume of gradients shared and the number of participants is not proportional to the variation in various system performance parameters. Specifically, an idealistic range of client and gradient-sharing fractions along with the appropriate value of noise for differential privacy implementation is determined. Additionally, we analyze the system from a security perspective as well as compare it with other schemes.

AB Federated learning has shown its unique advantages in many different tasks, including brain image analysis. It provides a new way to train deep learning models while protecting the privacy of medical image data from multiple sites. However, previous studies suggest that domain shift across different sites may influence the performance of federated models. As a solution, we propose a gradient matching federated domain adaptation (GM-FedDA) method for brain image classification, aiming to reduce domain discrepancy with the assistance of a public image dataset and train robust local federated models for target sites. It mainly includes two stages: 1) pretraining stage; we propose a one-common-source adversarial domain adaptation (OCS-ADA) strategy, i.e., adopting ADA with gradient matching loss to pretrain encoders for reducing domain shift at each target site (private data) with the assistance of a common source domain (public data) and 2) fine-tuning stage; we develop a gradient matching federated (GM-Fed) fine-tuning method for updating local federated models pretrained with the OCS-ADA strategy, i.e., pushing the optimization direction of a local federated model toward its specific local minimum by minimizing gradient matching loss between sites. Using fully connected networks as local models, we validate our method with the diagnostic classification tasks of schizophrenia and major depressive disorder based on multisite resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), respectively. Results show that the proposed GM-FedDA method outperforms other commonly used methods, suggesting the potential of our method in brain imaging analysis and other fields, which need to utilize multisite data while preserving data privacy.

AB In this article, we examine cloud-edge-terminal Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where edges undertake a range of typical dynamic scheduling tasks. In these IoT networks, a central policy for each task can be constructed at a cloud server. The central policy can be then used by the edges conducting the task, thereby mitigating the need for them to learn their own policy from scratch. Furthermore, this central policy can be collaboratively learned at the cloud server by aggregating local experiences from the edges, thanks to the hierarchical architecture of the IoT networks. To this end, we propose a novel collaborative policy learning framework for dynamic scheduling tasks using federated reinforcement learning. For effective learning, our framework adaptively selects the tasks for collaborative learning in each round, taking into account the need for fairness among tasks. In addition, as a key enabler of the framework, we propose an edge-agnostic policy structure that enables the aggregation of local policies from different edges. We then provide the convergence analysis of the framework. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the approaches without collaborative policy learning. Notably, it accelerates the learning speed of the policies and allows newly arrived edges to adapt to their tasks more easily.

AB With the rapid proliferation of smart mobile devices, federated learning (FL) has been widely considered for application in wireless networks for distributed model training. However, data heterogeneity, e.g., non-independently identically distributions and different sizes of training datasets among clients, poses major challenges to wireless FL. Limited communication resources complicate the implementation of fair scheduling which is required for training on heterogeneous data, and further deteriorate the overall performance. To address this issue, this paper focuses on performance analysis and optimization for wireless FL, considering data heterogeneity, combined with wireless resource allocation. Specifically, we first develop a closed-form expression for an upper bound on the FL loss function, with a particular emphasis on data heterogeneity described by a dataset size vector and a data divergence vector. Then we formulate the loss function minimization problem, under constraints on long-term energy consumption and latency, and jointly optimize client scheduling, uplink transmission power, channel allocation and the number of local epochs. Next, via the Lyapunov drift technique, we transform the optimization problem into a series of tractable problems. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other benchmarks in terms of the learning accuracy and energy consumption.

AB Jamming attack is one of the serious security breaches in the upcoming fifth-generation heterogeneous networks (5G HetNets). Most of the existing anti-jamming techniques, such as frequency hopping (FH) and direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) lack in self-adaptive capabilities to mitigate the security and privacy issues in highly dynamic 5G HetNet environment. In literature, although reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored a lot in designing various anti-jamming techniques to address the aforementioned problems, but these techniques suffer from the issue of large network resource consumption and slow convergence rate. To mitigate these issues, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based anti-jamming technique for two-tier 5G HetNets. In the proposal, each femtocell of 5G HetNets is assumed to have multiple single antenna femto users (FUs) and a multi-antenna jammer used to jam the downlink signals from femto base station (FBS) to FUs. Aiming to improve the achievable rate at FUs in the presence of jammers, a joint optimization problem of beamforming and power allocation at FBSs is formulated by considering the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of FUs. Due to the non-convex nature of the aforementioned optimization problem, we have used the Markov decision process (MDP) to transform the optimization problem into a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem. Then, to solve this MDP with large number of states and action spaces, a federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme is proposed to maximize the achievable rate at FUs. The proposed scheme uses federated learning and dueling architecture of dueling double deep Q network (D3QN) to optimize the beamforming vectors and power allocation jointly at FBSs. The achievable rate performance of the proposed federated DRL scheme is compared with double deep Q network (DDQN) and deep Q network (DQN). Simulation results show that the proposed federated DRL scheme achieves 19.39% and 23.85% better achievable rate in comparison to DDQN and DQN schemes.

AB Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial and pivotal functionality for home care robots that engage in intimate interactions with human individuals. However, the potential privacy risk associated with home care robots resides in their acquisition of facial information during expression recognition and subsequent data uploading for model updates. Federated learning (FL) can safeguard data privacy while enabling machine learning, yet its application to home care robots poses several challenges, including non -independent and non -identically distributed collected data, limited communication and computation capabilities on the robot side. However, limited research has been conducted in this area. In this paper, we propose a lightweight neural network architecture for the federated FER model on home care robots. We also introduce an efficient and simple lower -layer personalized FL method that optimizes local personalized models by exchanging fewer parameters. Furthermore, we implement a demo on real physical robots NAO to demonstrate how our federated model improves the performance of local FER models in non-IID data settings. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance on four simulated non-IID facial expression recognition (FER) datasets, comparable to larger network models and state-of-the-art algorithms. There is an average difference of approximately 3% from the best algorithm results on three datasets, while outperforming the best algorithm by 2% on one dataset. The evaluation of our methods on two real NAO robots shows that the overall performance improvement of our federated model over the locally independent model is about 20% on average.

TI FedDA: Resource-adaptive federated learning with dual-alignment
   aggregation optimization for heterogeneous edge devices

AB Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed learning paradigm that allows multiple clients to collaborate on training a global model without sharing their local data. However, in practical heterogeneous edge device scenarios, FL faces the challenges of system heterogeneity and data heterogeneity, which leads to unfair participation and degraded global model performance. In this paper, we introduce FedDA, a resource- adaptive FL framework, which adapts to the client's computing resources by assigning heterogeneous models of different sizes. To improve the performance of heterogeneous model aggregation and adjust to non- independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data, we propose a dual-alignment aggregation optimization method, i.e., parameter feature space alignment and output space alignment. Specifically, FedDA exploits the permutation symmetry property of weight space to permutate the model parameter positions via an adaptive layer-wise matching method, thereby aligning models with significant deviations in parameter feature space. FedDA mitigates the imbalance in parameter quantity between smaller and larger models through parameter expansion. Additionally, FedDA maps client labels into a uniform embedding space through output space alignment, thus reducing model parameter deviations due to non-i.i.d. data without additional client-side computing overhead. We evaluate the performance of FedDA on benchmark datasets, including FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and AGNews. Experimental results demonstrate that FedDA achieves up to 8.71% improvement in model accuracy compared to baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of heterogeneity.

AB Federated learning (FL), an emerging machine learning paradigm that trains a global model across distributed clients without violating data privacy, has recently attracted significant attention. However, FL's distributed nature and iterative training extensively increase the attacking surface for Byzantine and inference attacks. Existing FL defense methods can hardly protect FL from both Byzantine and inference attacks due to their fundamental conflicts. The noise injected to defend against inference attacks interferes with model weights and training data, obscuring model analysis that Byzantine-robust methods utilize to detect attacks. Besides, the practicability of existing Byzantine-robust methods is limited since they heavily rely on model analysis. In this article, we present SIREN+, a new robust FL system that defends against a wide spectrum of Byzantine attacks and inference attacks by jointly utilizing a proactive alarming mechanism and local differential privacy (LDP). The proactive alarming mechanism orchestrates clients and the FL server to collaboratively detect attacks using distributed alarms, which are free from the noise interference injected by LDP. Compared with the state-of-the-art defense methods, SIREN+ can protect FL from Byzantine and inference attacks from a higher proportion of malicious clients in the system while keeping the global model performing normally. Extensive experiments with diverse settings and attacks on real-world datasets show that SIREN+ outperforms existing defense methods when attacked by Byzantine and inference attacks.

AB Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications have diverse network session requirements. Certain critical applications, such as emergency alert relays, as well as industrial floor evacuation and surveillance systems, require fresh updates that can maintain the most recently delivered packets. This requires high reconfigurability to an extent where the system can measure the impact of an event and adapt the network accordingly. Recent research has demonstrated that network failures can undermine the sustainability of Industry 4.0 or Industrial IoT in general. In this paper, we design an intelligent Federated learning based Time-Sensitive Networking (Fed-TSN) controller framework to optimize the failure recovery. In industrial IoT scenarios, such as emergency evacuations on factory floors due to natural disasters, there can be multiple link failures with no disjoint paths which require a sustainable recovery solution. Accordingly, we consider multiple simultaneous link failures, both for networks with and without disjoint paths. The typically probabilistic network failures on a factory floor call for designing a mechanism that can search for routes with minimum joint failure probability (JFP). We formulate the JFP minimization problem as a non-linear integer program. We design a Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller that runs an application to produce near-optimal solutions for providing enhanced sustainability in a wide range of Industry 4.0 scenarios. We employ this non-linear integer program solution as input to our intelligent Fed-TSN fault recovery strategy that predicts the migration location based on the changes in the TSN gate schedule. We conduct simulations to quantify the improvements achieved with Fed-TSN compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative local training of forecasting models for distributed energy resources (DERs), thereby safeguarding the original energy data from exposure, which may contain user privacy or business secrets. However, traditional FL for DERs forecasting faces two significant challenges: (1) DERs data is typically non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), leading to poor forecasting performance. To address this issue, recent research has explored clustering FL. However, existing approaches often require clients to submit data for centralized clustering, ignoring privacy protection of clustering data. (2) DERs clients are vulnerable to Byzantines attacks. We propose a novel FL framework for DERs forecasting, named Clustered Federated Learning with an Intra-cluster Cross-validation mechanism (CFL-ICCV), to enhance both accuracy and security while preserving the data privacy of DERs clients. Within CFL-ICCV, DERs clients engage in distributed clustering by secret sharing, eliminating the need to submit original data. The ICCV mechanism ensures that local updates are validated by clients not participating in the current training round, allowing the identification and removal of malicious local models. Additionally, we design a parallel mode for ICCV, significantly reducing its associated overhead. Experimental results on the real-world dataset BDG2 demonstrate that, compared to baselines, CFL-ICCV reduces prediction error by 12.90% while protecting data privacy, and shows greater robustness against various Byzantine attacks by reducing prediction error at most 86.45% under attacks.

AB Federated edge learning (FEEL) is a popular distributed learning framework that allows privacy-preserving collaborative model training via periodic learning-updates communication between edge devices and server. Due to the constrained bandwidth, only a subset of devices can be selected to upload their updates at each training iteration. This has led to an active research area in FEEL studying the optimal device scheduling policy for communication time minimization. However, owing to the difficulty in quantifying the exact communication time, prior work in this area can only tackle the problem partially and indirectly by minimizing either the iteration rounds or per-round latency, while the total communication time is determined by both metrics. To close this research gap, we make the first attempt in this paper to formulate and solve the communication time minimization problem. We first derive a tight bound to approximate the remaining communication time through cross-disciplinary effort that combines the learning theory for convergence rate analysis and communication theory for per-round latency analysis. Building on the novel analytical result, an optimized probabilistic device scheduling policy is derived in closed-form by solving the approximate communication time minimization problem. It is found that the optimized policy gradually turns its priority from suppressing the remaining communication rounds to reducing per-round latency as the training process evolves. Extensive experiments based on real-world dataset and a use case on collaborative 3D objective detection in autonomous driving are provided to verify the superiority of the proposed policy over three benchmark policies based on the indirect solution approaches.

AB The global pandemic of COVID-19 has had profound and devastating effects on human life since its emergence in 2019. This viral infection predominantly impacts the respiratory system, causing a range of severity in alveolar overlapping that results in breathlessness and fatality. A novel methodology was assessed using the primary COVID-19 dataset from Kaggle, employing a federated learning ecosystem with multi-user datasets. This technique involves extracting data logs from various user repositories and datasets within the federated learning framework. Subsequently, a validation process is conducted, followed by computation utilizing a deep feature set categorization technique augmented by artificial intelligence. This augmented intelligence is showcased in a multi-layer image classification system designed for feature recognition and extraction. The training dataset, comprising 1056 data samples, is split into 647 for training and 409 for testing. Experimental outcomes highlighted a more comprehensive mapping and prioritization of features relative to attribute values. Remarkably, the proposed classification technique surpasses existing methods in accurately labeling COVID-19 detection as opposed to pneumonia and normal lung conditions in MRI/CT images.

TI Resource Optimization and Device Scheduling for Flexible Federated Edge
   Learning with Tradeoff Between Energy Consumption and Model Performance

AB Nowadays, users are becoming more reserved in uploading their own data to the servers of service providers for fear of personal information disclosure. In order to meet the need on privacy security, Federated Learning (FL) is proposed. As the nearest servers to users, edge servers are quite suitable for the execution of FL tasks, which results in a new concept called Federated Edge Learning (FEEL). It allows users to conduct model training locally without uploading their own data, thus avoiding privacy disclosure. However, the issue of Energy Consumption (EC) for training on devices becomes a main concern for users because the learning process is carried out on the devices with limited battery capacity. Then, from the standpoint of service providers, they pay more attention to the model performance (i.e., test dataset accuracy of the trained machine learning model) and usually have diverse requirements on it. Both EC and model performance are important metrics for FEEL, and from our engineering experience, service providers and users may have a conflict of interest in FEEL. In this paper, after modeling the two metrics, we identify the common factor (i.e., size of the training data) between them and are convinced that there is a tradeoff. Then, we add a workload constraint that regulates the common factor to the formulated problem and propose a resource optimization and device scheduling strategy to solve it, thus achieving the tradeoff between EC and model performance of FEEL. This strategy is based on the steepest descent method and approximation algorithm. The approximation ratio is also proved. By regulating the training workload threshold, the values of the two metrics can be dynamically adjusted. Achieving the tradeoff makes it possible to meet the needs of service providers and users at the same time. More specifically, it can minimize the energy consumption of training devices on the premise of meeting diverse requirements of service providers on model performance, which can not be realized by other FEEL frameworks that do not achieve the tradeoff. Simulation results show that our proposed strategy is able to achieve this tradeoff compared with two existing FEEL frameworks. Compared with another existing FEEL framework who also realizes the tradeoff, the tradeoff achieved by our proposed strategy is more biased towards EC. At the end of the simulation part, we summary the characteristics of the proposed and other three existing FEEL frameworks.

TI XMAM:X-raying models with a matrix to reveal backdoor attacks for
   federated learning
SO DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
DE Federated learning; Backdoor attacks; Aggregation methods
AB Federated Learning (FL), a burgeoning technology, has received increasing attention due to its privacy protection capability. However, the base algorithm FedAvg is vulnerable when it suffers from so-called backdoor attacks. Former researchers proposed several robust aggregation methods. Unfortunately, due to the hidden characteristic of backdoor attacks, many of these aggregation methods are unable to defend against backdoor attacks. What's more, the attackers recently have proposed some hiding methods that further improve backdoor attacks' stealthiness, making all the existing robust aggregation methods fail. To tackle the threat of backdoor attacks, we propose a new aggregation method, X-raying Models with A Matrix (XMAM), to reveal the malicious local model updates submitted by the backdoor attackers. Since we observe that the output of the Softmax layer exhibits distinguishable patterns between malicious and benign updates, unlike the existing aggregation algorithms, we focus on the Softmax layer's output in which the backdoor attackers are difficult to hide their malicious behavior. Specifically, like medical X-ray examinations, we investigate the collected local model updates by using a matrix as an input to get their Softmax layer's outputs. Then, we preclude updates whose outputs are abnormal by clustering. Without any training dataset in the server, the extensive evaluations show that our XMAM can effectively distinguish malicious local model updates from benign ones. For instance, when other methods fail to defend against the backdoor attacks at no more than 20% malicious clients, our method can tolerate 45% malicious clients in the black-box mode and about 30% in Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) mode. Besides, under adaptive attacks, the results demonstrate that XMAM can still complete the global model training task even when there are 40% malicious clients. Finally, we analyze our method's screening complexity and compare the real screening time with other methods. The results show that XMAM is about 10-10000 times faster than the existing methods.

TI Federated Unlearning: Guarantee the Right of Clients to Forget
SO IEEE NETWORK

DT Article

   Stochastic processes; Data models; Context modeling
AB The Right to be Forgotten gives a data owner the right to revoke their data from an entity storing it. In the context of federated learning, the Right to be Forgotten requires that, in addition to the data itself, any influence of the data on the FL model must disappear, a process we call "federated unlearning." The most straightforward and legitimate way to implement federated unlearning is to remove the revoked data and retrain the FL model from scratch. Yet the computational and time overhead associated with fully retraining FL models can be prohibitively expensive. In this article, we take the first step to comprehensively investigate the way to settle the unlearning paradigm in the context of federated learning. First, we define the problem of efficient federated unlearning, including its challenges and goals, and we identify three common types of federated unlearning requests: class unlearning, client unlearning, and sample unlearning. Based on those challenges and goals, a general pipeline is proposed for federated unlearning for the above three types of requests. We revisit how the training data affects the final FL model performance and thereby empowers the proposed framework with the reverse stochastic gradient ascent (SGA) and elastic weight consolidation (EWC). Various experiments are conducted to verify effectiveness of the proposed method in both aspects of unlearning efficacy and efficiency. We believe the proposed method will perform as an essential component for future machine unlearning systems.

TI Privacy-first health research with federated learning
SO NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Privacy protection is paramount in conducting health research. However, studies often rely on data stored in a centralized repository, where analysis is done with full access to the sensitive underlying content. Recent advances in federated learning enable building complex machine-learned models that are trained in a distributed fashion. These techniques facilitate the calculation of research study endpoints such that private data never leaves a given device or healthcare system. We show-on a diverse set of single and multi-site health studies-that federated models can achieve similar accuracy, precision, and generalizability, and lead to the same interpretation as standard centralized statistical models while achieving considerably stronger privacy protections and without significantly raising computational costs. This work is the first to apply modern and general federated learning methods that explicitly incorporate differential privacy to clinical and epidemiological research-across a spectrum of units of federation, model architectures, complexity of learning tasks and diseases. As a result, it enables health research participants to remain in control of their data and still contribute to advancing science-aspects that used to be at odds with each other.

TI Federated Graph Neural Networks: Overview, Techniques, and Challenges

DT Article; Early Access
DE Federated learning (FL); graph neural networks (GNNs)
AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted extensive research attention in recent years due to their capability to progress with graph data and have been widely used in practical applications. As societies become increasingly concerned with the need for data privacy protection, GNNs face the need to adapt to this new normal. Besides, as clients in federated learning (FL) may have relationships, more powerful tools are required to utilize such implicit information to boost performance. This has led to the rapid development of the emerging research field of federated GNNs (FedGNNs). This promising interdisciplinary field is highly challenging for interested researchers to grasp. The lack of an insightful survey on this topic further exacerbates the entry difficulty. In this article, we bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive survey of this emerging field. We propose a 2-D taxonomy of the FedGNN literature: 1) the main taxonomy provides a clear perspective on the integration of GNNs and FL by analyzing how GNNs enhance FL training as well as how FL assists GNN training and 2) the auxiliary taxonomy provides a view on how FedGNNs deal with heterogeneity across FL clients. Through discussions of key ideas, challenges, and limitations of existing works, we envision future research directions that can help build more robust, explainable, efficient, fair, inductive, and comprehensive FedGNNs.

AB As an alternative centralized systems, which may prevent data to be stored in a central repository due to its privacy and/or abundance, federated learning (FL) is nowadays a game changer addressing both privacy and cooperative learning. It succeeds in keeping training data on the devices, while sharing locally computed then globally aggregated models throughout several communication rounds. The selection of clients participating in FL process is currently at complete/quasi randomness. However, the heterogeneity of the client devices within Internet-of-Things environment and their limited communication and computation resources might fail to complete the training task, which may lead to many discarded learning rounds affecting the model accuracy. In this article, we propose FedMCCS, a multicriteria-based approach for client selection in FL. All of the CPU, memory, energy, and time are considered for the clients resources to predict whether they are able to perform the FL task. Particularly, in each round, the number of clients in FedMCCS is maximized to the utmost, while considering each client resources and its capability to successfully train and send the needed updates. The conducted experiments show that FedMCCS outperforms the other approaches by: 1) reducing the number of communication rounds to reach the intended accuracy; 2) maximizing the number of clients; 3) handling the least number of discarded rounds; and 4) optimizing the network traffic.

AB Background Federated learning (FL) is a technique for learning prediction models without sharing records between hospitals. Compared to centralized training approaches, the adoption of FL could negatively impact model performance.Aim This study aimed to evaluate four types of multicenter model development strategies for predicting 30-day mortality for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI): (1) central, learning one model from a centralized dataset of all hospitals; (2) local, learning one model per hospital; (3) federated averaging (FedAvg), averaging of local model coefficients; and (4) ensemble, aggregating local model predictions.Methods Data from all 16 Dutch TAVI hospitals from 2013 to 2021 in the Netherlands Heart Registration (NHR) were used. All approaches were internally validated. For the central and federated approaches, external geographic validation was also performed. Predictive performance in terms of discrimination [the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC, hereafter referred to as AUC)] and calibration (intercept and slope, and calibration graph) was measured.Results The dataset comprised 16,661 TAVI records with a 30-day mortality rate of 3.4%. In internal validation the AUCs of central, local, FedAvg, and ensemble models were 0.68, 0.65, 0.67, and 0.67, respectively. The central and local models were miscalibrated by slope, while the FedAvg and ensemble models were miscalibrated by intercept. During external geographic validation, central, FedAvg, and ensemble all achieved a mean AUC of 0.68. Miscalibration was observed for the central, FedAvg, and ensemble models in 44%, 44%, and 38% of the hospitals, respectively.Conclusion Compared to centralized training approaches, FL techniques such as FedAvg and ensemble demonstrated comparable AUC and calibration. The use of FL techniques should be considered a viable option for clinical prediction model development.

AB Federated learning (FL) provides a learning framework without participants sharing local raw data, but individual privacy is still at risk of disclosure through attacking the trained models. Due to the strong privacy guarantee, differential privacy (DP) is widely applied to FL to avoid privacy leakage. Traditional private learning adds noise directly to the gradients. The continuous accumulated noise on parameter models severely impairs learning effectiveness. To solve this problem, we introduce the idea of differentially private continuous data release (DPCR) into FL and propose an FL framework based on DPCR (FL-DPCR). Meanwhile, our proposed Equivalent Aggregation Theorem demonstrates that DPCR effectively reduces the overall error added to parameter models and improves FL's accuracy. To improve FL-DPCR's learning effectiveness, we introduce Matrix Mechanism to construct a release strategy and design a binary-indexed-tree (BIT) based DPCR model for Gaussian mechanism (BCRG). By solving a complex nonlinear programming problem with negative exponents, BCRG achieves optimal release accuracy efficiently. Besides, we exploit the residual privacy budget to boost the accuracy further and propose an advanced BCRG version (ABCRG). Our experiments show that, compared to traditional FL with DP, our achievements improve the accuracy with gains ranging from 3.4% on FMNIST to 65.7% on PAMAP2.

AB A variety of modern AI products essentially require raw user data for training diverse machine learning models. With the increasing concern on data privacy, federated learning, a decentralized learning framework, enables privacy-preserving training of models by iteratively aggregating model updates from participants, instead of aggregating raw data. Since all the participants, i.e., mobile devices, need to transfer their local model updates concurrently and iteratively over mobile edge networks, the network is easily overloaded, leading to a high risk of transmission failures. Although previous works on transmission protocols have already tried their best to avoid transmission collisions, the number of iterative concurrent transmissions should be fundamentally decreased. Inspired by the fact that raw data are often generated unevenly among devices, those devices with a small proportion of data could be properly excluded since they have little effect on the <italic>convergence</italic> of models. To further guarantee the <italic>accuracy</italic> of models, we propose to properly select a subset of devices as participants to ensure the given proportion of involved data. Correspondingly, we propose to minimize the risk against the transmission failures during model updates. Afterwards, we design a randomized algorithm to choose suitable participants by using a series of delicately calculated probabilities, and prove that the result is concentrated on its optimum with high probability. Extensive simulations show that through delicate participant selection, RFL decreases the maximal error rate of model updates by up to 38.3& x0025; compared with the state-of-the-art schemas.

AB Vertical federated learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning framework that enables devices to learn a global model from the feature-partition datasets without sharing local raw data. However, as the number of the local intermediate outputs is proportional to the training samples, it is critical to develop communication-efficient techniques for wireless vertical FL to support high-dimensional model aggregation with full device participation. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud radio access network (Cloud-RAN) based vertical FL system to enable fast and accurate model aggregation by leveraging over-the-air computation (AirComp) and alleviating communication straggler issue with cooperative model aggregation among geographically distributed edge servers. However, the model aggregation error caused by AirComp and quantization errors caused by the limited fronthaul capacity degrade the learning performance for vertical FL. To address these issues, we characterize the convergence behavior of the vertical FL algorithm considering both uplink and downlink transmissions. To improve the learning performance, we establish a system optimization framework by joint transceiver and fronthaul quantization design, for which successive convex approximation and alternate convex search based system optimization algorithms are developed. We conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system architecture and optimization framework for vertical FL.

AB Federated learning is increasingly popular, as it allows us to circumvent challenges due to data islands (e.g., challenges in getting access to raw datasets, particularly when data are owned by multiple data owners) by training a global model using data from one or more data owners / sources. However, in an edge computing deployment one cannot assume that resource-constrained end devices are sufficiently secure. In other words, we have to consider the possibility of these devices being compromised and can be abused to facilitate poisoning attacks. Privacy-preserving is another important property to consider when dealing with sensitive user data on end devices. Most existing approaches only consider either defending against poisoning attacks or supporting privacy, but not both properties simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a differentially private federated learning model against poisoning attacks, designed for edge computing deployment. First, we design a weight-based algorithm to perform anomaly detection on the parameters uploaded by end devices in edge nodes, which improves detection rate using only small-size validation datasets and minimizes the communication cost. Then, differential privacy technology is leveraged to protect the privacy of both data and model in an edge computing setting. We also evaluate the detection performance in the presence of random and customized malicious end devices, and compare its performance with those of two other competing approaches published in IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, in terms of attack resiliency, and communication and computation costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can achieve an optimal tradeoff between security, efficiency and accuracy.

AB This paper applies federated reinforcement learning (FRL) in cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication to enable vehicles to learn communication parameters in collaboration with a parameter server that is embedded in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Different sensors in vehicles capture different types of data, contributing to data heterogeneity. C-V2X communication networks impose additional communication overhead in order to converge to a global model when the sensor data are not independent-and-identically-distributed (non-i.i.d.). Consequently, the training time for local model updates also varies considerably. Using FRL, we accelerated this convergence by minimizing communication rounds, and we delayed it by exploring the correlation between the data captured by various vehicles in subsequent time steps. Additionally, as UAVs have limited battery power, processing of the collected information locally at the vehicles and then transmitting the model hyper-parameters to the UAVs can optimize the available power consumption pattern. The proposed FRL algorithm updates the global model through adaptive weighing of Q-values at each training round. By measuring the local gradients at the vehicle and the global gradient at the UAV, the contribution of the local models is determined. We quantify these Q-values using nonlinear mappings to reinforce positive rewards such that the contribution of local models is dynamically measured. Moreover, minimizing the number of communication rounds between the UAVs and vehicles is investigated as a viable approach for minimizing delay. A performance evaluation revealed that the FRL approach can yield up to a 40% reduction in the number of communication rounds between vehicles and UAVs when compared to gross data offloading.

AB Due to the contradiction between limited bandwidth and huge transmission parameters, federated Learning (FL) has been an ongoing challenge to reduce the model parameters that need to be transmitted to server in clients for fast transmission. Existing works that attempt to reduce the amount of transmitted parameters have limitations: 1) the reduced number of parameters is not significant; 2) the performance of the global model is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Fed-KGF that significantly reduces the amount of model parameters while improving the global model performance. Our goal is to reduce those transmitted parameters by reducing the number of convolution kernels. Specifically, we construct an incomplete model with a few representative convolution kernels, and propose Kernel Generation Function (KGF) to generate other convolution kernels to render the incomplete model to be a complete one. We discard those generated kernels after training local models, and solely transmit those representative kernels during training, thereby significantly reducing the transmitted parameters. Furthermore, there is a client-drift in the traditional FL because of the averaging method, which hurts the global model performance. We innovatively select one or few modules from all client models in a permutation way, and only aggregate the uploaded modules rather than averaging all modules to reduce client-drift, thus improving the global model performance and further reducing the transmitted parameters. Experimental results on both non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) and IID scenarios for image classification and object detection tasks demonstrate that our Fed-KGF outperforms SOTA FL models.

AB Proactive content caching has emerged as a promising solution to cope with exponentially increasing mobile data traffic. The popular user contents can be cached near the network edge for faster retrieval and processing. Current state-of-the-art approaches adopt a centralized model training mechanism that requires high communication and data exchange overheads to predict content popularity. Moreover, these approaches fail to deal with the dynamicity of the environment since they do not take into account the users' mobility information and are unable to incorporate content offload timings. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a novel federated learning-based Mobility and Demand-aware Proactive Content Offloading (MDPCO) framework. MDPCO exploits distributed learning strategies and capitalizes on users' mobility and demand information for proactive content offloading. Extensive simulations are carried out to validate the efficacy of MDCPO against local and cloud-based models. Our proposed model yields an average performance improvement of 6.7% in comparison to the cloud-based model. Furthermore, with the increase in the number of fog servers, the MDPCO achieves a 9.8% higher data offloading ratio and 1.18% increase in the downlink rates while being more energy-efficient than cloud-based approaches.

AB Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted much attention in the field of machine learning due to their remarkable success in learning from graph-structured data. However, implementing GNNs in practice faces a critical bottleneck from the high complexity of communication and computation, which arises from the frequent exchange of graphic data during model training, especially in limited communication scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework of federated graph neural networks, where multiple mobile users collaboratively train the global model of graph neural networks in a federated way. The utilization of federated learning into the training of graph neural networks can help reduce the communication overhead of the system and protect the data privacy of local users. In addition, the federated training can help reduce the system computational complexity significantly. We further introduce a greedy-based user selection for the federated graph neural networks, where the wireless bandwidth is dynamically allocated among users to encourage more users to attend the federated training of neural networks. We perform the convergence analysis on the federated training of neural networks, in order to obtain some more insights on the impact of critical parameters on the system design. Finally, we perform the simulations on the coriolis ocean for reAnalysis (CORA) dataset and show the advantages of the proposed method in this paper.

ID DDOS ATTACK DETECTION
AB Software-defined networking (SDN) is an innovative network technology. It changed the world of computer networking by providing solutions to many challenges. SDN provides programmability, easy and centralized network management, dynamic configuration, and improved security. Although SDN offers remarkable benefits but it provides centralized network management which is prone to attacks. So, intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential to detect and prevent security attacks in SDN. Traditional IDS follow a centralized machine learning approach which causes vulnerabilities in IDS. Old-style IDS lack data privacy preservation, and solution for training data unavailability due to privacy. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach which provides a collaborative training approach without data sharing. In FL, training is performed on multiple nodes creating a global model without sharing the data. To address challenges and the limitations of traditional IDS, we proposed a FL based multi class classification IDS for SDN. FL delivers an efficient and scalable solution to address challenges of traditional IDS. The proposed model enhances security of SDN by not requiring the centralization of data. To test the impact and efficiency of proposed model, we used a latest and realistic cybersecurity dataset. We also compared the proposed model with state of art existing multi class classification studies. The results and their comparison with existing studies highlight the potential of proposed model to enhance network security while providing a privacy-preserving learning environment for intrusion detection.

ID RELAY SELECTION; OPTIMIZATION
AB Consider a wireless federated learning (WFL) system where the edge devices (EDs) performing local training are closely located in a cluster, such that in addition to their private model updates, a locally common (a.k.a. consensus) model can be computed or selected at each cycle of the learning process. For such a clustered WFL (CWFL) paradigm, we design an uplink (UL) radio access scheme based on the rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) architecture, which is shown not only to significantly reduce the latency of WFL in comparison to systems employing time-domain multiple access (TDMA) and nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA), but also to be more energy efficient, reaching a lower latency with less power than the latter alternatives. To that end, we exploit the cluster-wide consensus model as the common message used to construct the common component of the RSMA scheme and build an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the latency of each CWFL round by means of optimally allocating the corresponding computation times and uplink transmission durations of each ED, taking into account constraints such as energy consumption, data rates and computational capabilities of each ED. By adequately setting a system parameter referred to as the rate-splitting factor, the formulation also applies to systems employing conventional TDMA or NOMA methods, such that the proposed technique can be seen as a generalization of those approaches, in the context of CWFL schemes. Simulation results on the proposed RSMA-interfaced UL scheme for CWFL are given, both with and without the incorporation of optimal NOMA decoding at the base station (BS), the first of which is found to yield only a mild improvement over the latter, indicating that the proposed approach is in fact the key factor in the overall latency reduction achieved.

ID RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; OPTIMIZATION
AB In federated learning (FL), a number of devices train their local models and upload the corresponding parameters or gradients to the base station (BS) for global model updates. However, the eavesdropper can recover data from parameters or gradients, resulting in data leakage. To defend against eavesdropping attacks, in this article, we propose an algorithm that divides the transmit power proportionally between the transmitted signal and artificial noise (AN) to counteract the eavesdropper for wireless FL. In this algorithm, due to the limited communication resources, the ratio of signal power to total power and the aggregation frequency need to be carefully chosen, to guarantee the model accuracy and security at the same time. In order to achieve this goal, we maximize the secrecy rate with the system/user power and model performance constraints. To make this problem tractable, we derive two bounds of the secrecy rate and loss function, which allows us to obtain closed-form expressions for the power of AN and the aggregation frequency. Furthermore, in order to make our analysis more realistic, we consider the FL model with channel fading and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) over uplink and downlink, respectively. Specifically, we discuss the convergence of FL over noisy multiple access channels (MACs). Simulation results confirm the convergence and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of machine learning (ML) models while preserving user data privacy. Existing FL approaches can potentially facilitate collaborative ML, but ensuring secure trading/sharing of training data is challenging in practice, particularly in the presence of adversarial FL clients. The ongoing security concerns around FL and strict laws on personally identifiable information necessitate the design of a robust and trusted FL framework, for example, using blockchain. Existing blockchain-based solutions are generally not of industrial strength, where limitations include scalability and lack of engagement by participating clients. In this article, blockchain-in-the-loop FL is our proposed approach of intertwining classic FL and Hyperledger Fabric with a gamification component. Our proposed approach is a fusion of secure application integrated to seal and sign-off asynchronous and synchronous collaborative tasks of FL. The enterprise-level blockchain network provides an immutable ledger that can be leveraged at different FL layers to ensure auditable tracing and level-up security in industrial settings. We evaluate our proposed approach with three different datasets to demonstrate the security enhancements that improve the FL process, resulting in a more accurate global ML model to converge with the possible best performance.

AB Industrial Internet mobile edge computing (MEC) deploys edge servers near base stations to bring computing resources to the edge of industrial networks to meet the energy-saving requirements of Industrial Internet terminal devices. This paper considers a wireless MEC system in an intelligent factory that has multiple edge servers and mobile smart industrial terminal devices. In this paper, the terminal device has the choice of either offloading the task in whole or in part to the edge server, or performing it locally. Through combined optimization of the task offload ratio, number of subcarriers, transmission power, and computing frequency, the system can achieve minimum total energy consumption. A computing offloading and resource allocation approach that combines federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is suggested to address the optimization problem. According to the simulation results, the proposed algorithm displays fast convergence. Compared with baseline algorithms, this algorithm has significant advantages in optimizing the performance of energy consumption.

AB When data privacy is imposed as a necessity, Federated learning (FL) emerges as a relevant artificial intelligence field for developing machine learning (ML) models in a distributed and decentralized environment. FL allows ML models to be trained on local devices without any need for centralized data transfer, thereby reducing both the exposure of sensitive data and the possibility of data interception by malicious third parties. This paradigm has gained momentum in the last few years, spurred by the plethora of real-world applications that have leveraged its ability to improve the efficiency of distributed learning and to accommodate numerous participants with their data sources. By virtue of FL, models can be learned from all such distributed data sources while preserving data privacy. The aim of this paper is to provide a practical tutorial on FL, including a short methodology and a systematic analysis of existing software frameworks. Furthermore, our tutorial provides exemplary cases of study from three complementary perspectives: i) Foundations of FL, describing the main components of FL, from key elements to FL categories; ii) Implementation guidelines and exemplary cases of study, by systematically examining the functionalities provided by existing software frameworks for FL deployment, devising a methodology to design a FL scenario, and providing exemplary cases of study with source code for different ML approaches; and iii) Trends, shortly reviewing a non-exhaustive list of research directions that are under active investigation in the current FL landscape. The ultimate purpose of this work is to establish itself as a referential work for researchers, developers, and data scientists willing to explore the capabilities of FL in practical applications.

AB The emergence of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) signifies a transformative paradigm for intelligent and interconnected transportation systems. However, the effective sharing of data within the IoV ecosystem presents significant challenges including security, privacy, and efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IoV-SFL, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates Federated Learning (FL) and blockchain technology to provide a comprehensive solution. By employing federated learning, IoV-SFL framework ensures that data remains on local devices, preserving user privacy, while consortium blockchain enhances security and transparency. Furthermore, the IoV-SFL framework also leverages the capabilities of Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Dynamic Scaling Factor to enable privacy-preserving computations, optimize resource allocation, and enhance efficiency. The incorporation of Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) within the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model empowers the IoV-SFL framework to extract meaningful insights from heterogeneous data streams. Rigorous experiments have validated the superior performance of the IoV-SFL framework compared to conventional approaches in terms of security, communication efficiency, model accuracy, and convergence speed. Additionally, a comprehensive security and privacy analysis highlights IoV-SFL's robustness against diverse threats and vulnerabilities. The IoV-SFL framework represents a groundbreaking advancement, offering a secure and efficient means of data sharing in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), paving the way for innovative vehicular applications and safer transportation systems.

AB 5G's service providers now leverage Deep Learning (DL) to automate their network slice management, provisioning, and security. To this end, each slice owner contributes data to feed a common dataset used to train centralized learning models. However, this method raises privacy considerations that prevent its usage. Therefore, Federated learning (FL), a collaborative approach that ensures data privacy, is being investigated while striving toward the same performance as centralized learning. As 5G and beyond services are so diverse, the local slice's data is not intended to reflect the entire data distribution. Thus, local data of slices are NonIndependently and non-Identically distributed (Non-IID), posing a challenge for FL-based models. In this paper, we investigate the use of FL to secure network slices and detect potential attacks. For that purpose, we first propose an architecture for deploying intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in 5G and beyond networks. Next, we thoroughly evaluate the latest state-of-art FL algorithms, including FedAvg, FedProx, FedPer, and SCAFFOLD, in the context of Independently and Identically Distributed (IID) and Non-IID data distributions. We compare these FL models to centralized and local DL models. We find that SCAFFOLD outperforms all the other FL algorithms and ensures a stable learning loss convergence, a promising finding that strengthens the case for leveraging FL in IDS development. Nevertheless, none of the FL models could achieve the centralized model's performance in Non-IID scenarios.

AB We propose an autonomous blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) design for privacy-aware and efficient vehicular communication networking, where local on-vehicle machine learning (oVML) model updates are exchanged and verified in a distributed fashion. BFL enables oVML without any centralized training data or coordination by utilizing the consensus mechanism of the blockchain. Relying on a renewal reward approach, we develop a mathematical framework that features the controllable network and BFL parameters (e.g., the retransmission limit, block size, block arrival rate, and the frame sizes) so as to capture their impact on the system-level performance. More importantly, our rigorous analysis of oVML system dynamics quantifies the end-to-end delay with BFL, which provides important insights into deriving optimal block arrival rate by considering communication and consensus delays. We present a variety of numerical and simulation results highlighting various non-trivial findings and insights for adaptive BFL design. In particular, based on analytical results, we minimize the system delay by exploiting the channel dynamics and demonstrate that the proposed idea of tuning the block arrival rate is provably online and capable of driving the system dynamics to the desired operating point. It also identifies the improved dependency on other blockchain parameters for a given set of channel conditions, retransmission limits, and frame sizes. (1) However, a number of challenges (gaps in knowledge) need to be resolved in order to realise these changes. In particular, we identify key bottleneck challenges requiring further investigations, and provide potential future reserach directions. (1) An early version of this work has been accepted for presentation in IEEE WCNC Wksps 2020 [1].

AB Standardizing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with 6TiSCH enables the IIoT nodes to utilize low power with high reliability. It ensures the allocation of resources for IIoT nodes with minimal power consumption. The existing work focused on various issues in the 6TiSCH-based IIoT in terms of network formation, and scheduling. However, security, energy efficiency, and latency remain challenging issues. The aforementioned issues are resolved by adopting different technologies in the 6TiSCH IIoT environment such as edge computing and federated learning named AIFed-6TiSCH IIoT. In the 6TiSCH layer, all IIoT nodes are authenticated to the Trusted Authority (TA) to reduce unwanted malicious traffic using Hybrid Authentication Algorithm (HAS) named Mchacha-poly 1305 algorithm based on several credentials. The authenticated nodes are allowed to form the network, for that we utilized a multicast CORONA-based DODAG structure using the Dijkstra algorithm. Eventually, new node joining is initiated by an already joined node which transmits Enhanced Beacons (EBs) in adaptive time intervals for synchronizing the new node. The synchronized nodes aim to select the optimal parent for transmitting data to the root node using an Enhanced Sea Gull (ESG) optimization algorithm based on mobility and several information. After that, optimal channel selection and scheduling are done using a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) algorithm named TOPSIS and a hybrid scheduling algorithm (i.e., Autonomous, and centralized scheduling) based on federated learning. By Performing channel selection, the congestion rate is reduced and federated learning ensures privacy and communication reliability. In the edge layer, data from the root are forwarded via a smart gateway to the edge servers for local processing. The security and latency issues in the edge layer are mitigated by performing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based migration named Enhanced Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (EMADDPG) that runs based on three policies. In addition, a virtual edge server is deployed in case of excess search time and overloading. The simulation of the proposed work is carried out using Cooja simulation based on Contiki 3x OS, and the simulation results are validated with existing works in terms of several validation metrics. The validation results show that the proposed work outperforms the existing works.

AB Federated learning (FL) has recently received considerable attention and is becoming a popular machine learning (ML) framework that allows clients to train machine learning models in a decentralized fashion without sharing any private dataset. In the FL framework, data for learning tasks are acquired and processed locally at the edge node, and only the updated ML parameters are transmitted to the central server for aggregation. However, because local FL parameters and the global FL model are transmitted over wireless links, wireless network performance will affect FL training performance. In particular, the number of resource blocks is limited; thus, the number of devices participating in FL is limited. Furthermore, edge nodes often have substantial constraints on their resources, such as memory, computation power, communication, and energy, severely limiting their capability to train large models locally. This paper proposes a two-hop communication protocol with a dynamic resource allocation strategy to investigate the possibility of bandwidth allocation from a limited network resource to the maximum number of clients participating in FL. In particular, we utilize an ordinary hierarchical FL with an adaptive grouping mechanism to select participating clients and elect a leader for each group based on its capability to upload the aggregated parameters to the central server. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms the baseline algorithm in terms of communication cost and model accuracy.

AB Aiming at balancing data privacy and availability, Google introduces the concept of federated learning, which can construct global machine learning models over multiple participants while keeping their raw data localized. However, the exchanged parameters in traditional federated learning may still reveal the data information. Meanwhile, the training data are usually partitioned vertically in real-world scenes, which causes difficulties in model construction. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving vertical federated tree boosting framework, namely SGBoost, where multiple participants can collaboratively perform model training and query without staying online all the time. Specifically, we first design secure bucket sharing and best split finding algorithms, with which the global tree model can be constructed over vertically partitioned data; meanwhile, the privacy of training data can be well guaranteed. Then, we design an oblivious query algorithm to utilize the trained model without leaking any query data or results. Moreover, SGBoost does not require multi-round interactions between participants, significantly improving the system efficiency. Detailed security analysis shows that SGBoost can well guarantee the privacy of raw data, weights, buckets, and split information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGBoost can achieve high accuracy comparable to centralized training and efficient performance.

AB One of the most critical challenges for deploying distributed learning solutions, such as federated learning (FL), in wireless networks is the limited battery capacity of mobile clients. While it is a common belief that the major energy consumption of mobile clients comes from the uplink data transmission, this paper presents a novel finding, namely channel decoding also contributes significantly to the overall energy consumption of mobile clients in FL. Motivated by this new observation, we propose an energy-efficient adaptive channel decoding scheme that leverages the intrinsic robustness of FL to model errors. In particular, the robustness is exploited to reduce the energy consumption of channel decoders at mobile clients by adaptively adjusting the number of decoding iterations. We theoretically prove that wireless FL with communication errors can converge at the same rate as the case with error-free communication provided the bit error rate (BER) is properly constrained. An adaptive channel decoding scheme is then proposed to improve the energy efficiency of wireless FL systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains the same learning accuracy while reducing the channel decoding energy consumption by similar to 20 % when compared to an existing approach.

AB Large constellations of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites have been launched for Earth observation and satellite-ground communication, which collect massive imagery and sensor data. These data can enhance the AI capabilities of satellites to address global challenges such as real-time disaster navigation and mitigation. Prior studies proposed leveraging federated learning (FL) across satellite-ground to collaboratively train a share machine learning (ML) model in a privacy-preserving mechanism. However, they mostly focus on single unique challenges such as limited ground-to-satellite bandwidth, short connection window, and long connection cycle, while ignoring the completeness of these challenges in deploying efficient FL frameworks in space. In this paper, we propose an efficient satellite-ground FL framework, SatelliteFL, to address these three challenges collectively. Its key idea is to ensure that each satellite must complete per-round training within each connection window. Moreover, we design a progressive block-wise quantization algorithm that determines a unique bitwidth for each block of the ML model to maximize the model utility while not exceeding the connection window. We evaluate SatelliteFL by plugging an implemented FL platform into real-world satellite networks and satellite images. The results show that SatelliteFL highly accelerates the convergence by up to 2.8x and improves the bandwidth utilization ratio by up to 9.3x compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB The data in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) contains tremendous market value, and data sharing can maximize the usefulness of the data. However, certain data is quite sensitive, and sharing it directly may violate privacy. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a secure distributed machine learning framework that completes joint model training by passing encrypted model parameters rather than raw data, so there is no data privacy leakage during the training process. Therefore, the VFL can build a bridge between data demander and owner to realize data sharing while protecting data privacy. Typically, the VFL requires a third party for key distribution and decryption of training results. In this article, we employ the consortium blockchain instead of the traditional third party and design a VFL architecture based on the consortium blockchain for data sharing in MEC. More specifically, we propose a V-Raft consensus algorithm based on Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs), which is a variant of the Raft. The V Raft is able to elect leader quickly and stably to assist data demander and owner to complete data sharing by VFL. Moreover, we apply secret sharing to distribute the private key to avoid the situation where the training result cannot be decrypted if the leader crashes. Finally, we analyzed the performance of the V-Raft and carried out simulation experiments, and the results show that compared with Raft, the V-Raft has higher efficiency and better scalability.

AB Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to efficient machine learning with privacy protection in distributed environments, such as Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile-edge computing (MEC). The effectiveness of FL relies on a group of participant nodes that contribute their data and computing capacities to the collaborative training of a global model. Therefore, preventing malicious nodes from adversely affecting the model training while incentivizing credible nodes to contribute to the learning process plays a crucial role in enhancing FL security and performance. Seeking to contribute to the literature, we propose a blockchain-empowered secure and incentive FL (BESIFL) paradigm in this article. Specifically, BESIFL leverages blockchain to achieve a fully decentralized FL system, where effective mechanisms for malicious node detections and incentive management are fully integrated in a unified framework. The experimental results show that the proposed BESIFL is effective in improving FL performance through its protection against malicious nodes, incentive management, and selection of credible nodes.

AB Federated learning (FL) has received significant at-tention as a practical alternative to traditional cloud-centric ma-chine learning (ML). The performance (e.g., accuracy and conver-gence time) of FL is hampered by the selection of clients having non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. In addition, a long convergence time is inevitable if clients with poor computation or communication capabilities participate in the FL procedure (i.e., the straggler problem). To minimize convergence time while guaranteeing high learning accuracy, we first formulate an optimization problem on client selection. As a practical solution, we devise a data distribution-aware online client selection (DOCS) algorithm. In DOCS, the FL server finds several clusters having near IID data and then uses a multi-armed bandit (MAB) technique to select the cluster with the lowest convergence time. The evalu-ation results demonstrate that DOCS can reduce the convergence time by up to 10% similar to 41% and improve the learning accuracy by up to 4% similar to 13% compared to the traditional client selection schemes.

AB Federated learning (FL) is rapidly gaining popularity and enables multiple data owners ( a.k.a. FL participants) to collaboratively train machine learning models in a privacy-preserving way. A key unaddressed scenario is that these FL participants are in a competitive market, where market shares represent their competitiveness. Although they are interested to enhance the performance of their respective models through FL, market leaders (who are often data owners who can contribute significantly to building high performance FL models) want to avoid losing their market shares by enhancing their competitors' models. Currently, there is no modeling tool to analyze such scenarios and support informed decision-making. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing the mar ket s hare-based decision support framework for participation in FL (MarS-FL). We introduce two notions of delta delta-stable market and friendliness to measure the viability of FL and the market acceptability of FL. The FL participants' behaviours can then be predicted using game theoretic tools (i.e., their optimal strategies concerning participation in FL). If the market delta -stability is achievable, the final model performance improvement of each FL-PT shall be bounded, which relates to the market conditions of FL applications. We provide tight bounds and quantify the friendliness, kappa , of given market conditions to FL. Experimental results show the viability of FL in a wide range of market conditions. Our results are useful for identifying the market conditions under which collaborative FL model training is viable among competitors, and the requirements that have to be imposed while applying FL under these conditions.

AB Critical infrastructures (e.g., energy and transportation systems) are essential lifelines for most modern sectors and have utmost significance in our daily lives. However, these important domains can fail to operate due to system failures or natural disasters. Though the major disturbances in such critical infrastructures are rare, the severity of such events calls for the development of effective resilience assessment strategies to mitigate relative losses. Traditional critical infrastructure resilience approaches consider that the available critical infrastructure agents are resource-sufficient and agree to exchange local data with the server and other agents. Such assumptions create two issues: (1) uncertainty in reaching convergence while applying learning strategies on resource-constrained critical infrastructure agents, and (2) a huge risk of privacy leakage. By understanding the pressing need to construct an effective resilience model for resource-constrained critical infrastructure, this paper aims at leveraging a distributed machine learning technique called Federated Learning (FL) to tackle an agent's resource limitations effectively and at the same time keep the agent's information private. Particularly, this paper is focused on predicting the probable outage and resource status of critical infrastructure agents without sharing any local data and carrying out the learning process even when most of the agents are incapable of accomplishing a given computational task. To that end, an FL algorithm is designed specifically for a resource-constrained critical infrastructure environment that could facilitate the training of each agent in a distributed fashion, restrict them from sharing their raw data with any other external entities (e.g., server, neighbor agents), choose proficient clients by analyzing their resources, and allow a partial amount of computation tasks to be performed by the resource-constrained agents. We considered a different number of agents with various stragglers and checked the performance of FedAvg and our proposed FedResilience algorithm with prediction tasks for a probable outage, as well as checking the agents' resource-sharing scope. Our simulation results show that if the majority of the FL agents are stragglers and we drop them from the training process, then the agents learn very slowly and the overall model performance is negatively affected. We also demonstrate that the selection of proficient agents and allowing them to complete only parts of their tasks can significantly improve the knowledge of each agent by eliminating the straggler effects, and the global model convergence is accelerated.

AB The coupling of federated learning (FL) and multi-access edge computing (MEC) has the potential to foster numerous applications. However, it poses great challenges to train FL fast enough with limited communication and computing resources of mobile edge devices. Motivated by recent development in ultra fast wireless transmissions and promising advances in artificial intelligence (AI) computing hardware of mobile devices, in this paper, we propose a time efficient FL over future mobile edge devices, called dynamic batch sizes assisted federated learning (DBFL) with convergence guarantee. The DBFL allows batch sizes to increase dynamically during training, which can unleash the computing potential of GPU's parallelism for on- device training and effectively leverage the fast wireless transmissions (WiFi-6, 5G, 6G, etc.) of mobile edge devices. Furthermore, based on the derived DBFL's convergence bound, we develop a batch size control scheme to minimize the total time consumption of FL over mobile edge devices, which trade-offs the "talking ", i.e., communication time, and "working ", i.e., computing time, by adjusting the incremental factor appropriately. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed DBFL algorithm and demonstrate that our scheme outperforms existing time efficient FL approaches in terms of the total time consumption in various settings.

ID DISPATCH PROBLEM; OPTIMIZATION
AB The effective load prediction capability of Energy Aggregation Service Providers is fundamental to their participation in the electricity market and a crucial factor in maximizing their market profits. However, a major challenge we face is that the data required for prediction is typically scattered across individual energy entities, and due to concerns regarding data security and privacy, these entities are often unwilling to share their data. This issue hampers the operational efficiency of Energy Aggregation Service Providers and also impedes the learning and analysis of relevant energy supplier operational patterns. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Federated Learning -based load prediction method for Energy Aggregation Service Providers, allowing them to share information without accessing the actual datasets, thereby obtaining accurate and effective load prediction capabilities. Firstly, an artificial neural network with multidimensional environmental feature selection is established based on task requirements. Then, a weighted average strategy is employed to jointly train the artificial neural network, bridging the gap between individual energy entities and environmental features. Finally, the trained model features are sent to the server of the energy aggregation service provider for fitting. Through a case study using partial data from a large-scale energy aggregation service provider in a southern city of China, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving overall operational efficiency and average prediction accuracy.

DT Article
DE Federated learning; Privacy-preserving; Quantization; Model poisoning
   attack; Model corruption
AB The use of cryptographic privacy-preserving techniques in Federated Learning (FL) inadvertently induces a security dilemma because tampered local model parameters are encrypted and thus prevented from auditing. This work firstly demonstrates the triviality of performing model corruption attacks against privacy-preserving FL. We consider the scenario where the model updates are quantized to reduce the communication overhead, whilst the adversary can simply provide local parameters out of a legitimate range to corrupt the model. We then propose MUD-PQFed, a protocol that can precisely detect malicious attacks and enforce fair penalties on malicious clients. By deleting the contributions from the detected malicious clients, the global model utility is preserved as compared to the baseline global model in the absence of the corruption attack. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA benchmark datasets validate the efficacy in terms of retaining the baseline accuracy and effectiveness in terms of detecting malicious clients in a fine-grained manner.

AB Wireless charging vehicle to grid (V2G) system is not-so-futuristic. It can maintain the power supply balance and stabilize the grid through a wireless link between vehicles using batteries based on energy supply-demand statistics. Most of the existing privacy preservation methods are based on data tampering approaches (e.g., encryption, adding noise, aggregation), which are not practicable over V2G due to complexity in billing and inaccurate state estimation. In this paper, we develop a novel adaptive demand-side energy management framework by employing federated learning-based privacy preservation for the wireless charging V2G systems. Our framework learns the temporal evolution of energy consumption of dynamic charging electric vehicles in a distributed fashion and exploits the reinforcement learning model for cost-saving and reward maximization. The convergence and the privacy preservation properties of the framework are demonstrated with extensive evaluations.

AB We study federated learning (FL), where power-limited wireless devices utilize their local datasets to collaboratively train a global model with the help of a remote parameter server (PS). The PS has access to the global model and shares it with the devices for local training using their datasets, and the devices return the result of their local updates to the PS to update the global model. The algorithm continues until the convergence of the global model. This framework requires downlink transmission from the PS to the devices and uplink transmission from the devices to the PS. The goal of this study is to investigate the impact of the bandwidth-limited shared wireless medium on the performance of FL with a focus on the downlink. To this end, the downlink and uplink channels are modeled as fading broadcast and multiple access channels, respectively, both with limited bandwidth. For downlink transmission, we first introduce a digital approach, where a quantization technique is employed at the PS followed by a capacity-achieving channel code to transmit the global model update over the wireless broadcast channel at a common rate such that all the devices can decode it. Next, we propose analog downlink transmission, where the global model is broadcast by the PS in an uncoded manner. We consider analog transmission over the uplink in both cases, since its superiority over digital transmission for uplink has been well studied in the literature. We further analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed analog transmission approach over the downlink assuming that the uplink transmission is error-free. Numerical experiments show that the analog downlink approach provides significant improvement over the digital one with a more notable improvement when the data distribution across the devices is not independent and identically distributed. The experimental results corroborate the convergence analysis, and show that a smaller number of local iterations should be used when the data distribution is more biased, and also when the devices have a better estimate of the global model in the analog downlink approach.

DE AIGIC; Image data; Lightweight; Privacy-preserving; Federated learning
AB With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and Big Data, the application of artificial intelligence-generated image content (AIGIC) is becoming increasingly widespread in various fields. However, the image data utilized by AIGIC is diverse and often contains sensitive personal information, characterized by heterogeneity and privacy concerns. This leads to prolonged implementation times for image data privacy protection, and a high risk of unauthorized third-party access, resulting in serious privacy breaches and security risks. To address this issue, this paper combines Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) with Homomorphic Encryption to first address the encryption and transmission challenges in the image processing pipeline of AIGIC. Building upon this foundation, a novel HFL group collaborative training strategy is designed to further streamline the privacy protection process of AIGIC image data, effectively masking the heterogeneity of raw image data and achieving balanced allocation of computational resources. Additionally, a model compression algorithm based on pruning is introduced to alleviate the data transmission pressure in the image encryption process. Optimization of the homomorphic encryption modulo operations significantly reduces the computational burden, enabling real-time enhancement of image data privacy protection from multiple dimensions including computational and transmission resources. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, extensive simulation verification of the lightweight privacy protection process for AIGIC image data was performed, and a comparative analysis of the time complexity of the mechanism was conducted. Experimental results indicate substantial advantages of the proposed algorithm over traditional real-time privacy protection algorithms in AIGIC.

AB Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been introduced as a promising technology that allows a secondary system to access the licensed spectrum of the primary system to improve spectrum utilization. In this paper, we introduce Fed-MADRL by incorporating federated learning (FL) and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) to design a collaborative DSA strategy. Our Fed-MADRL scheme employs FL to enable multiple users to collaboratively optimize the system goal without sharing their training data. By keeping all the training data at the user end, FL improves the communication efficiency and strengthens user data privacy. To further reduce the communication overheads, each user only shares quantized information. We provide the convergence analysis to characterize the trade-off between the communication efficiency and the system performance. In particular, we show that the introduced method converges at a rate O(1/K-1/4), where K is the number of FL iterations. To the best of our knowledge, Fed-MADRL is the first work that utilizes FL in DSA networks under quantized communication. Performance evaluation results show that the introduced Fed-MADRL method outperforms the independent learning method and achieves comparable performance with the centralized MADRL method, which requires much higher communication overheads.

ID ADVERSARIAL ROBUSTNESS
AB Deep learning (DL) methods have been widely applied to anomaly-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) to detect malicious traffic. To expand the usage scenarios of DL-based methods, federated learning (FL) allows multiple users to train a global model on the basis of respecting individual data privacy. However, it has not yet been systematically evaluated how robust FL-based NIDSs are against existing privacy attacks under existing defenses. To address this issue, we propose two privacy evaluation metrics designed for FL-based NIDSs, including (1) privacy score that evaluates the similarity between the original and recovered traffic features using reconstruction attacks, and (2) evasion rate against NIDSs using adversarial attack with the recovered traffic. We conduct experiments to illustrate that existing defenses provide little protection and the corresponding adversarial traffic can even evade the SOTA NIDS Kitsune. To defend against such attacks and build a more robust FL-based NIDS, we further propose FedDef, a novel optimization-based input perturbation defense strategy with theoretical guarantee. It achieves both high utility by minimizing the gradient distance and strong privacy protection by maximizing the input distance. We experimentally evaluate four existing defenses on four datasets and show that our defense outperforms all the baselines in terms of privacy protection with up to 7 times higher privacy score, while maintaining model accuracy loss within 3% under optimal parameter combination.

AB Recently, deep neural networks have shown remarkable success in fault diagnosis in power systems using partial discharges (PDs), thereby enhancing grid asset safety and reliability. However, the prevailing approaches often adopt centralized large-scale datasets for training, without taking into account the impact of noise environments for Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs). Noise environments for PD measurements in gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) introduce variations in feature distributions and class representations, challenging the generalization ability of the trained models in new and diverse conditions. In this study, we propose a Shared Knowledge-based Contrastive Federated Learning (SK-CFL) for PD diagnosis in different noise environments for IEDs. The proposed SK-CFL combines federated learning principles with contrastive learning, empowering IEDs to collaboratively learn and share knowledge as regards PD and noise patterns. The proposed framework can learn representations between the same patterns across different IEDs while ensuring data privacy. Experimental results for PD diagnosis in GIS show that the proposed SK-CFL achieves a performance improvement in fault diagnosis, particularly in new and unseen environments. Specifically, the recall for unknown noise in untrained IED 6 demonstrates 92.86% of the proposed SK-CFL, in comparison with 64.29% and 35.71% of the conventional FL and baseline method, respectively. These results suggest that the proposed SK-CFL approach promises more adaptable, and resilient data-driven approaches since it protects data privacy that can operate effectively in challenging real-world environments.

AB Privacy protection as a major concern of the industrial big data enabling entities makes the massive safety-critical operation data of a wind turbine unable to exert its great value because of the threat of privacy leakage. How to improve the diagnostic accuracy of decentralized machines without data transfer remains an open issue; especially these machines are almost accompanied by skewed class distribution in the real industries. In this study, a class-imbalanced privacy-preserving federated learning framework for the fault diagnosis of a decentralized wind turbine is proposed. Specifically, a biometric authentication technique is first employed to ensure that only legitimate entities can access private data and defend against malicious attacks. Then, the federated learning with two privacy-enhancing techniques enables high potential privacy and security in low-trust systems. Then, a solely gradient-based self-monitor scheme is integrated to acknowledge the global imbalance information for class-imbalanced fault diagnosis. We leverage a real-world industrial wind turbine dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. By comparison with five state-of-the-art approaches and two nonparametric tests, the superiority of the proposed framework in imbalanced classification is ascertained. An ablation study indicates that the proposed framework can maintain high diagnostic performance while enhancing privacy protection.

This study evaluated the value of federated learning (FL) technology in PTE prognosis risk assessment while ensuring the security of clinical data.Methods A retrospective dataset consisted of PTE patients from 12 hospitals were collected, and 19 physical indicators of patients were included to train the FL-based prognosis assessment model to predict the 30-day death event. Firstly, multiple machine learning methods based on FL were compared to choose the superior model. And then performance of models trained on the independent (IID) and non-independent identical distributed(Non-IID) datasets was calculated and they were tested further on Real-world data. Besides, the optimal model was compared with pulmonary embolism severity index (PESI), simplified PESI (sPESI), Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH).Methods A retrospective dataset consisted of PTE patients from 12 hospitals were collected, and 19 physical indicators of patients were included to train the FL-based prognosis assessment model to predict the 30-day death event.

ID ENCRYPTION
AB This study introduces a blockchain-based lightweight encryption strategy with federated learning to address the scalability and trust concerns of electronic health records (EHR). After implementing lightweight encryption, the EHR data is stored in a decentralized cloud system. The importance of protecting the privacy and security of distant patients' health records is explored. Now that stakeholders have a secure portal and cloud data is inaccessible, assaults on electronic healthcare records should decrease. The study guarantees full encryption throughout the whole conversation with federated learning. Deprived of the essential for a trusted third party, the system sets up active smart contracts at runtime between the sensor and the data user to facilitate the transfer of EHR data. To ensure that the data is private between the owner and user during the contract's execution, it employs a very effective proxy re-encryption mechanism with federated learning. To examine the performance of the proposed system, it has been built and deployed on an Ethereum-based testbed. It is observed that the PSNR and MSE of the proposed model are 39 ( 1.07x ) and 229.6 ( 1.02x ) respectively. The entropy of the image is assessed to be 7.8 for the proposed model. This is also compared with existing algorithms and proved to be a secured model.

This article combines wireless powered communication (WPC) technology with an MEC network, where a base station (BS) can transfer wireless energy to edge users (EUs) and execute computation-intensive tasks through task offloading. Traditional numerical optimization methods are time-consuming approaches for solving this problem in time-varying wireless channels, and centralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is not stable in large-scale dynamic IoT networks. Therefore, we propose a federated DRL-based online task offloading and resource allocation (FDOR) algorithm. In this algorithm, DRL is executed in EUs, and federated learning (FL) uses the distributed architecture of MEC to aggregate and update the parameters. To further solve the problem of the non-IID data of mobile EUs, we devise an adaptive method that automatically adjusts the FDOR algorithm's learning rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FDOR algorithm is superior to the traditional numerical optimization method and the existing DRL algorithm in four aspects: convergence speed, execution delay, overall calculation rate and stability in large-scale and dynamic IoT.

AB Due to the diverse equipment and uneven load distribution in industrial environments, data regarding faults are often unbalanced. Moreover, data and models from clients may become contaminated or damaged, affecting diagnostic performance. To overcome these problems, this study proposes a stacking model for diagnosing interturn short circuit (ITSC) faults in permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). Federated learning (FL) is used to train the model to increase data security and overcome data islanding in distributed scenarios. Moreover, an improved verification strategy was adopted to select appropriate client models in each round to update the FL global model. We created a secondary server-side data set to validate the client weightings. The data set contains clean sample data for all ITSC fault categories. By calculating the fault diagnosis accuracy of the global model on the auxiliary data set, the model eliminates low-quality clients with uneven fault distributions. The improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the weight coefficients of clients involved in aggregation, improving the robustness of the aggregation strategy under a joint learning system. In evaluation experiments, compared with the federated average (FedAvg) model, the proposed dynamic verification model exhibited the better diagnostic accuracy in situations of data imbalance, incurred lower communication costs, and prevented local oscillations in the model.

AB Historical patients' medical data has an important impact on the healthcare industry for providing the best care to patients through intelligent health diagnosis and prediction of diseases. The existing intelligent health diagnosis systems collect data from medical institutions or laboratories and then use machine learning algorithms to predict diseases. But, in most cases, the medical institutions have incomplete medical data of the patients since a patient may consult different specialists (from various hospitals) during the treatment process. To overcome this problem, we build a smart and secure federated learning framework for intelligent health diagnosis with a blockchain-based incentive mechanism and nonfungible tokens (NFTs)-based marketplace. We make use of NFTs to develop clear demarkations on the ownership and accessibility of the data of patients. We create an NFT marketplace that manages access to the historical medical data of patients. A comprehensive incentive mechanism based on several factors, including the quality and relevance of the data, the frequency, regularity of data uploading, etc., is incorporated to encourage and penalize the patients based on their contributions to the global model. We used the Polyak-averaging technique for aggregating local models to form a global model. The extensive analysis shows that the proposed model achieves comparable performance with the centralized machine learning models while affording better security and access to better data. The results also show the efficacy of the proposed blockchain-based incentive mechanism.

AB COVID-19 is a serious epidemic that not only endangers human health, but also wreaks havoc on the development of society. Recently, there has been research on using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for COVID-19 detection. As AI has entered the era of big models, deep learning methods based on pre-trained models (PTMs) have become a focus of industrial applications. Federated learning (FL) enables the union of geographically isolated data, which can address the demands of big data for PTMs. However, the incompleteness of the healthcare system and the untrusted distribution of medical data make FL participants unreliable, and medical data also has strong privacy protection requirements. Our research aims to improve training efficiency and global model accuracy using PTMs for training in FL, reducing computation and communication. Meanwhile, we provide a secure aggregation rule using differential privacy and fully homomorphic encryption to achieve a privacy-preserving Byzantine robust federal learning scheme. In addition, we use blockchain to record the training process and we integrate a Byzantine fault tolerance consensus to further improve robustness. Finally, we conduct experiments on a publicly available dataset, and the experimental results show that our scheme is effective with privacy-preserving and robustness. The final trained models achieve better performance on the positive prediction and severe prediction tasks, with an accuracy of 85.00% and 85.06%, respectively. Thus, this indicates that our study is able to provide reliable results for COVID-19 detection.

AB Due to limited network resources in internet of vehicles (IoV), vehicle's heterogenous data, communication and computing resources significantly impact the training delay and model accuracy of federated learning (FL). To enhance resource utilization in IoV and mitigate the impact of limited resources on FL, we propose a resource allocation strategy to optimize computing and communication resource distribution within IoV. Additionally, A vehicle selection strategy based on vehicle data, communication and computing resources is introduced to reduce the impact of resource and data heterogeneity on FL. To further enhance FL training efficiency, a hierarchical FL algorithm that integrates vehicle selection and resource allocation based on deep deterministic policy gradients is designed. The vehicle selection and resource allocation problems are modeled as a Markov decision process. Deep reinforcement learning is adopted to find the optimal strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves rapid convergence. It significantly reduces FL training latency while ensuring training accuracy.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in many fields. However, large-scale DNNs also bring storage costs when storing snapshots for preventing clusters' frequent failures or incur significant communication overheads when transmitting DNNs in the Federated Learning (FL). Recently, several approaches, such as Delta-DNN and LC-Checkpoint, aim to reduce the size of DNNs' snapshot storage by compressing the difference between two neighboring versions of the DNNs (a.k.a., delta). However, we observe that existing approaches, applying traditional global lossy quantization techniques in DNN's delta compression, can not fully exploit the data similarity since the parameters' value ranges vary among layers. To fully explore the similarity of the delta model and improve the compression ratio, we propose a quantization-based local-sensitive delta compression approach, named QD-Compressor, by developing a layer-based local-sensitive quantization scheme and error feedback mechanism. Specifically, the quantizers and number of quantization bits are adaptive among layers based on the value distribution and weighted entropy of the delta's parameters. To avoid quantization error degrading the performance of the restored model, an alternative error feedback mechanism is designed to dynamically correct the quantization error during the training process. Experiments on multiple popular DNNs and datasets show that QD-Compressor obtains a higher 7x-40x compression ratio in the model snapshot compression scenario than the state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, QD-Compressor achieves an 11x-15x compression ratio to the residual model of the Federated Learning compression scenario.

AB Federated learning is a widely used distributed learning approach in recent years, however, despite model training from collecting data become to gathering parameters, privacy violations may occur when publishing and sharing models. A dynamic approach is proposed to add Gaussian noise more effectively and apply differential privacy to federal deep learning. Concretely, it is abandoning the traditional way of equally distributing the privacy budget epsilon $\mathbf{{\epsilon}}$ and adjusting the privacy budget to accommodate gradient descent federation learning dynamically, where the parameters depend on computation derived to avoid the impact on the algorithm that hyperparameters are created manually. It also incorporates adaptive threshold cropping to control the sensitivity, and finally, moments accountant is used to counting the epsilon $\mathbf{{\epsilon}}$ consumed on the privacy-preserving, and learning is stopped only if the epsilon total ${\mathbf{{\epsilon}}}_{total}$ by clients setting is reached, this allows the privacy budget to be adequately explored for model training. The experimental results on real datasets show that the method training has almost the same effect as the model learning of non-privacy, which is significantly better than the differential privacy method used by TensorFlow.

AB Face presentation attack detection (fPAD) plays a critical role in the modern face recognition pipeline. An fPAD model with good generalization can be obtained when it is trained with face images from different input distributions and different types of spoof attacks. In reality, training data (both real face images and spoof images) are not directly shared between data owners due to legal and privacy issues. In this article, with the motivation of circumventing this challenge, we propose a federated face presentation attack detection (FedPAD) framework that simultaneously takes advantage of rich fPAD information available at different data owners while preserving data privacy. In the proposed framework, each data owner (referred to as data centers) locally trains its own fPAD model. A server learns a global fPAD model by iteratively aggregating model updates from all data centers without accessing private data in each of them. Once the learned global model converges, it is used for fPAD inference. To equip the aggregated fPAD model in the server with better generalization ability to unseen attacks from users, following the basic idea of FedPAD, we further propose a federated generalized face presentation attack detection (FedGPAD) framework. A federated domain disentanglement strategy is introduced in FedGPAD, which treats each data center as one domain and decomposes the fPAD model into domain-invariant and domain-specific parts in each data center. Two parts disentangle the domain-invariant and domain-specific features from images in each local data center. A server learns a global fPAD model by only aggregating domain-invariant parts of the fPAD models from data centers, and thus, a more generalized fPAD model can be aggregated in server. We introduce the experimental setting to evaluate the proposed FedPAD and FedGPAD frameworks and carry out extensive experiments to provide various insights about federated learning for fPAD.

AB With the development of big data, data sharing has become a hot topic. According to the previous research on data sharing, there is a problem with regard to how to design an effective incentive mechanism to make users willing to share data. First, we integrate the incentives based on reputation and payment and introduce "credibility coins" as a cryptocurrency for data-sharing transactions, to encourage users to participate honestly in the data-sharing process based on federated learning. Second, we propose a dynamic incentive model based on the evolutionary game theory to model the game process of users in data sharing and analyze the stability of their strategies. Finally, based on the results of this analysis, we use the blockchain-based smart contract technology to dynamically adjust the participation benefits of users under different conditions in order to promote users to join consortium blockchains more often and steadily to participate in model training for federated learning and obtain better model accuracy. Our work is the first to apply the evolutionary game theory to the study of incentives in federated learning, and plays a leading role in the study of incentives in federated learning. Experimental simulation validation shows that our DIM-DS model can adequately motivate users to participate in the collaborative task of data sharing and maintain stability. The model can maximize the effectiveness of the federated learning model.

AB The recent appearance of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies applied in the maritime industry has introduced the Internet of Ships (IoS) paradigm. By leveraging IoS and deep learning (DL), various DL-based fault diagnosis methods have been proposed to improve shipping companies' maintenance performance and reduce operational costs. However, the traditional centralized learning approach (CL), which centralizes the data resources of different shipping companies to a cloud server for model training, is restricted in real industrial scenarios due to privacy concerns and business competitions. In this article, we propose a novel adaptive privacy-preserving federated learning approach, named AdaPFL, for fault diagnosis in IoS, which can organize different shipping agents to collaboratively develop a model by sharing model parameters with no risk of data leakage. First, we use two common tasks as examples to demonstrate that a small part of the model parameters might reveal the shipping agents' raw information. Based on this, the Paillier-based communication scheme is designed to preserve the raw information of the shipping agents. Furthermore, to deal with the harsh marine environment, a control algorithm is proposed to adaptively change the model aggregation interval during the training process for reducing cryptography computation and communication costs. Theoretical analysis and experiments prove the high effectiveness of the AdaPFL on a real nonindependent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d) fault data set.

AB Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful machine learning technique that enables the development of models from decentralized data sources. However, the decentralized nature of FL makes it vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of malicious attacks on FL by covering various aspects such as attack budget, visibility, and generalizability, among others. Previous surveys have primarily focused on the multiple types of attacks and defenses but failed to consider the impact of these attacks in terms of their budget, visibility, and generalizability. This survey aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive understanding of the attacks' effect by identifying FL attacks with low budgets, low visibility, and high impact. Additionally, we address the recent advancements in the field of adversarial defenses in FL and highlight the challenges in securing FL. The contribution of this survey is threefold: first, it provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the current state of FL attacks and defenses. Second, it highlights the critical importance of considering the impact, budget, and visibility of FL attacks. Finally, we provide ten case studies and potential future directions towards improving the security and privacy of FL systems.

AB Mobile crowdsourcing federated learning (FL-MCS) allows a requester to outsource its model-training tasks to other workers who have the desired data as well as strong computing power. FL-MCS can thereby overcome the limitations of computing capability as well as the data availability of participants. However, FL-MCS still faces the problem of workers' data privacy leakage when diverse malicious attacks (e.g., gradient inference attacks) are launched. To address these problems, some privacy-preserving FL-MCS (PPFL-MCS) schemes are proposed to aggregate local models at a central server. Unfortunately, these schemes are vulnerable to single-point-of-failure and other malicious attacks at the central server. Meanwhile, the workers may drop from the online task due to the erratic communication network in PPFL-MCS schemes, thereby resulting in the failure of the entire model aggregation. To solve these issues, we propose a novel dropout-tolerated and privacy-preserving decentralized FL-MCS scheme, namely, dropout-tolerated decentralized PPFL-MCS based on blockchain. Specifically, we define a novel cryptographic primitive, i.e., ID-based Aggregated Decryptable Broadcast Encryption (AD-IBBE) based on traditional ID-based broadcast encryption. In AD-IBBE, the senders' ciphertexts can only be decrypted by themselves while the aggregated ciphertexts can be decrypted by all receivers in the broadcast group. Then, we design a homomorphic AD-IBBE algorithm, which is formally proved to be semantically secure. We next devise the decentralized PPFL-MCS scheme to guarantee the confidentiality of model gradients against internal and external adversaries. Moreover, we design a dropout-tolerated aggregation method to ensure the robustness of our decentralized PPFL-MCS scheme even if some workers lose connection. Extensive experimental results on different models and data sets demonstrate that the proposed scheme guarantees a close model accuracy to the nondropout case. Even when some workers are offline, our scheme still performs more efficiently than existing schemes in terms of dropout aggregation overhead.

AB In this paper, the convergence time of federated learning (FL), when deployed over a realistic wireless network, is studied. In particular, a wireless network is considered in which wireless users transmit their local FL models (trained using their locally collected data) to a base station (BS). The BS, acting as a central controller, generates a global FL model using the received local FL models and broadcasts it back to all users. Due to the limited number of resource blocks (RBs) in a wireless network, only a subset of users can be selected to transmit their local FL model parameters to the BS at each learning step. Moreover, since each user has unique training data samples, the BS prefers to include all local user FL models to generate a converged global FL model. Hence, the FL training loss and convergence time will be significantly affected by the user selection scheme. Therefore, it is necessary to design an appropriate user selection scheme that can select the users who can contribute toward improving the FL convergence speed more frequently. This joint learning, wireless resource allocation, and user selection problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the FL convergence time and the FL training loss. To solve this problem, a probabilistic user selection scheme is proposed such that the BS is connected to the users whose local FL models have significant effects on the global FL model with high probabilities. Given the user selection policy, the uplink RB allocation can be determined. To further reduce the FL convergence time, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to estimate the local FL models of the users that are not allocated any RBs for local FL model transmission at each given learning step, which enables the BS to improve the global model, the FL convergence speed, and the training loss. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can reduce the FL convergence time by up to 56% and improve the accuracy of identifying handwritten digits by up to 3%, compared to a standard FL algorithm.

AB Traditional machine learning techniques require centralizing all training data on one server or data hub. However, with the development of communication technologies and a huge amount of decentralized data on many clients, collaborative machine learning has become the main interest while providing privacy-preserving frameworks. Federated learning (FL) provides such a solution to learn a shared model while keeping training data at local clients. On the other hand, in a wide range of machine learning and signal processing applications, the desired solution naturally has a certain structure that can be framed as sparsity with respect to a certain dictionary. This problem can be formulated as an optimization problem with sparsity constraints and solving it efficiently has been one of the primary research topics in the traditional centralized setting. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework, federated gradient matching pursuit (FedGradMP), to solve the sparsity constrained minimization problem in the FL setting. We also generalize our algorithms to accommodate various practical FL scenarios when only a subset of clients participate per round, when the local model estimation at clients could be inexact, or when the model parameters are sparse with respect to general dictionaries. Our theoretical analysis shows the linear convergence of the proposed algorithms. A variety of numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the great potential of the proposed framework - fast convergence both in communication rounds and computation time for many important scenarios without intricate parameter tuning.

AB The past decade has seen substantial growth in the prevalence and capabilities of wearable devices. For instance, recent human activity recognition (HAR) research has explored using wearable devices in applications such as remote monitoring of patients, detection of gait abnormalities, and cognitive disease identification. However, data collection poses a major challenge in developing HAR systems, especially because of the need to store data at a central location. This raises privacy concerns and makes continuous data collection difficult and expensive due to the high cost of transferring data from a user's wearable device to a central repository. Considering this, we explore the adoption of federated learning (FL) as a potential solution to address the privacy and cost issues associated with data collection in HAR. More specifically, we investigate the performance and behavioral differences between FL and deep learning (DL) HAR models, under various conditions relevant to real-world deployments. Namely, we explore the differences between the two types of models when (i) using data from different sensor placements, (ii) having access to users with data from heterogeneous sensor placements, (iii) considering bandwidth efficiency, and (iv) dealing with data with incorrect labels. Our results show that FL models suffer from a consistent performance deficit in comparison to their DL counterparts, but achieve these results with much better bandwidth efficiency. Furthermore, we observe that FL models exhibit very similar responses to those of DL models when exposed to data from heterogeneous sensor placements. Finally, we show that the FL models are more robust to data with incorrect labels than their centralized DL counterparts.

AB The proliferation of low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite networks leads to the generation of vast volumes of remote sensing data which is traditionally transferred to the ground server for centralized processing, raising privacy and bandwidth concerns. Federated edge learning (FEEL), as a distributed machine learning approach, has the potential to address these challenges by sharing only model parameters instead of raw data. Although promising, the dynamics of LEO networks, characterized by the high mobility of satellites and short ground-to-satellite link (GSL) duration, pose unique challenges for FEEL. Notably, frequent model transmission between the satellites and ground incurs prolonged waiting time and large transmission latency. This paper introduces a novel FEEL algorithm, named FedMega, tailored to LEO mega-constellation networks. By integrating inter-satellite links (ISL) for intra-orbit model aggregation, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the usage of low data-rate and intermittent GSL. Our proposed method includes a ring all-reduce based intra-orbit aggregation mechanism, coupled with a network flow-based transmission scheme for global model aggregation, which enhances transmission efficiency. Theoretical convergence analysis is provided to characterize the algorithm performance. Extensive simulations show that our FedMega algorithm outperforms existing satellite FEEL algorithms, exhibiting an approximate 30% improvement in convergence rate.

AB In healthcare, data privacy of patients regulations prohibits data from being moved outside the hospital, preventing international medical datasets from being centralized for AI training. Federated learning (FL) is a data privacy-focused method that trains a global model by aggregating local models from hospitals. Existing FL techniques adopt a central server-based network topology, where the server assembles the local models trained in each hospital to create a global model. However, the server could be a point of failure, and models trained in FL usually have worse performance than those trained in the centralized learning manner when the patient's data are not independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) in the hospitals. This paper presents a decentralized FL framework, including training with adaptive ensemble learning and a deployment phase using knowledge distillation. The adaptive ensemble learning step in the training phase leads to the acquisition of a specific model for each hospital that is the optimal combination of local models and models from other available hospitals. This step solves the non-IID challenges in each hospital. The deployment phase adjusts the model's complexity to meet the resource constraints of wearable systems. We evaluated the performance of our approach on edge computing platforms using EPILEPSIAE and TUSZ databases, which are public epilepsy datasets.

AB The continual evolution of the digital health domain has led to an increased dependence on intelligent devices, such as smart bands and smartwatches, for monitoring personal well-being. These devices produce significant amounts of sensitive and personal data daily, underscoring the critical importance of safeguarding the privacy and security of this information. In response to this pressing challenge. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework incorporating deep learning, federated learning, IPFS (a secure data storage system), and blockchain technology. Our approach begins by utilizing deep learning to anonymize sensitive healthcare data, ensuring the protection of individual identities. Subsequently, this anonymized data is securely stored on IPFS, A decentralized and tamperproof data storage platform. We employ federated learning to improve models without exposing raw data, enabling distributed dataset training. Blockchain plays a crucial role by establishing transparent and immutable data access records, thereby enhancing security and accountability, a particularly critical aspect in healthcare where data integrity is paramount. The primary objective is to balance data privacy and usability for research purposes. Testing our framework with a well-established dataset (CIFAR-10) resulted in a high accuracy rate of 84.59% while preserving data privacy. This framework serves as a robust solution for protecting IoT healthcare data, integrating advanced technologies to meet the specific demands of the field. The implications of this research extend beyond current circumstances, offering a potential shift in the healthcare data handling paradigm.

AB Federated learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning paradigm that allows to accomplish model training without aggregating data at a central server. Most studies on FL consider a centralized framework, in which a single server is endowed with a central authority to coordinate a number of devices to perform model training in an iterative manner. Due to stringent communication and bandwidth constraints, such a centralized framework has limited scalability as the number of devices grows. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a ConFederated Learning (CFL) framework. The proposed CFL consists of multiple servers, in which each server is connected with an individual set of devices as in the conventional FL framework, and decentralized collaboration is leveraged among servers to make full use of the data dispersed throughout the network. We develop a stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for CFL. The proposed algorithm employs a random scheduling policy which randomly selects a subset of devices to access their respective servers at each iteration, thus alleviating the need of uploading a huge amount of information from devices to servers. Theoretical analysis is presented to justify the proposed method. Numerical results show that the proposed method can converge to a decent solution significantly faster than gradient-based FL algorithms, thus boasting a substantial advantage in terms of communication efficiency.

AB Federated learning allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without exchanging their data, thus preserving data privacy. Unfortunately, it suffers significant performance degradation due to heterogeneous data at clients. Common solutions involve designing an auxiliary loss to regularize weight divergence or feature inconsistency during local training. However, we discover that these approaches fall short of the expected performance because they ignore the existence of a vicious cycle between feature inconsistency and classifier divergence across clients. This vicious cycle causes client models to be updated in inconsistent feature spaces with more diverged classifiers. To break the vicious cycle, we propose a novel framework named Federated learning with Feature Anchors (FedFA). FedFA utilizes feature anchors to align features and calibrate classifiers across clients simultaneously. This enables client models to be updated in a shared feature space with consistent classifiers during local training. Theoretically, we analyze the non-convex convergence rate of FedFA. We also demonstrate that the integration of feature alignment and classifier calibration in FedFA brings a virtuous cycle between feature and classifier updates, which breaks the vicious cycle existing in current approaches. Extensive experiments show that FedFA significantly outperforms existing approaches on various classification datasets under label distribution skew and feature distribution skew.

AB Opportunistic IoT networks are the type of wireless network that operate in challenging and dynamic environments where traditional network infrastructure is unreliable, limited, or non-existent. Due to these unreliable network conditions, traditional routing algorithms can not be applied to them. Further, in today's interconnected world, where a vast amount of personal and sensitive information is transmitted over networks, it is important to address the growing concerns over the privacy and security of users' data in communication networks. To mitigate this, a novel federated learning approach for routing optimisation in opportunistic IoT networks is proposed, where nodes opportunistically select the next-hop relay for message forwarding based on the current network state and local knowledge. Extensive simulation and analysis showcase the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed FLRouter in achieving efficient and privacy-aware routing within opportunistic IoT networks. The proposed approach outperforms existing methods in delivery probability, with gains of up to 16% and 13% as buffer size increases. Additionally, it demonstrates lower overhead ratios, with reductions of up to 42% and 34% compared to existing approaches.

AB This study explores the benefits of integrating the novel clustered federated learning (CFL) approach with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) datasets, where multiple devices participate in the aggregation with time limitations and a finite number of sub-channels. A detailed theoretical analysis of the generalization gap that measures the degree of non-IID in the data distribution is presented. Following that, solutions to address the challenges posed by non-IID conditions are proposed with the analysis of the properties. Specifically, users' data distributions are parameterized as concentration parameters and grouped using spectral clustering, with Dirichlet distribution serving as the prior. The investigation into the generalization gap and convergence rate guides the design of sub-channel assignments through the matching-based algorithm, and the power allocation is achieved by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with the derived closed-form solution. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed cluster-based FL framework can outperform FL baselines in terms of both test accuracy and convergence rate. Moreover, jointly optimizing sub-channel and power allocation in NOMA-enhanced networks can lead to a significant improvement.

AB The smart power grid is a critical energy infrastructure where real-time electricity usage data is collected to predict future energy requirements. The existing prediction models focus on the centralized frameworks, where the collected data from various home area networks (HANs) are forwarded to a central server. This process leads to cybersecurity threats. This article proposes a federated learning based model with privacy preservation of smart grids data using serverless cloud computing. The model considers the blockchain-enabled dew servers in each HAN for local data storage and local model training. Advanced perturbation and normalization techniques are used to reduce the inverse impact of irregular workload on the training results. The experiment conducted on benchmarks datasets demonstrates that the proposed model minimizes the computation and communication costs, attacking probability, and improves the test accuracy. Overall, the proposed model enables smart grids with robust privacy preservation and high accuracy.

AB Glioma, a primary tumor derived from brain glial cells, is around 45% of all intracranial tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging's (MRI's) precise glioma segmentation is crucial for clinical purposes. This article presents a novel automatic brain tumor segmentation approach based on a multi-encoder-based federated intelligent deep learning framework. The suggested method uses a U-shaped network design that multiplies the single contraction path into several paths to explore semantic information modalities deeply. The basic convolutional layer uses an Inception module and dilated convolutions to extract multi-scale features from the images using artificial intelligent. To emphasize segmentation-related information while ignoring redundant channel dimension information and improving the accuracy of network segmentation, lightweight channel attention efficient channel attention (ECA) modules are inserted into the bottleneck layer and decoder. The collection of data for the 2018 Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS 2018) is used to test the effectiveness of the suggested structure, and the findings indicate that the growth core, for the entire tumor and the augmented tumor regions, respectively, the average Dice coefficients are 0.880, 0.784, and 0.757. These findings support the proposed algorithm's ability to accurately and successfully segregate multimodal MRI brain tumors.

AB At present, the centralized learning models, used for IoT applications generating large amount of data, face several challenges such as bandwidth scarcity, more energy consumption, increased uses of computing resources, poor connectivity, high computational complexity, reduced privacy, and large latency towards data transfer. In order to address the aforementioned challenges, Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning Networks (BFLNs) emerged recently, which deal with trained model parameters only, rather than raw data. BFLNs provide enhanced security along with improved energy-efficiency and Quality-of-Service (QoS). However, BFLNs suffer with the challenges of exponential increased action space in deciding various parameter levels towards training and block generation. Motivated by aforementioned challenges of BFLNs, in this work, we are proposing an actor-critic Reinforcement Learning (RL) method to model the Machine Learning Model Owner (MLMO) in selecting the optimal set of parameter levels, addressing the challenges of exponential grow of action space in BFLNs. Further, due to the implicit entropy exploration, actor-critic RL method balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off and shows better performance than most off-policy methods, on large discrete action spaces. Therefore, in this work, considering the mobile scenario of the devices, MLMO decides the data and energy levels that the mobile devices use for the training and determine the block generation rate. This leads to minimized system latency and reduced overall cost, while achieving the target accuracy. Specifically, we have used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as an on-policy actor-critic method with it's two variants, one based on Monte Carlo (MC) returns and another based on Generalized Advantage Estimate (GAE). We analyzed that PPO has better exploration and sample efficiency, lesser training time, and consistently higher cumulative rewards, when compared to off-policy Deep Q-Network (DQN).

AB Nowadays, wireless communication is rapidly reshaping entire industry sectors. In particular, mobile-edge computing (MEC) as an enabling technology for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) brings a powerful computing/storage infrastructure closer to the mobile terminals and, thereby, significantly lowers the response latency. To reap the benefit of proactive caching at the network edge, precise knowledge on the popularity pattern among the end devices is essential. However: 1) the spatiotemporal variability of content popularity; 2) the data deficiency in privacy-preserving system; 3) the costly manual labels in supervised learning; as well as 4) the not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) user behaviors pose tough challenges to the acquisition and prediction of content popularities. In this article, we propose an unsupervised and privacy-preserving popularity prediction framework for MECenabled IIoT to achieve a high popularity prediction accuracy while addressing the challenges. Specifically, the concepts of local and global popularities are introduced and the time-varying popularity of each user is modeled as a model-free Markov chain. On this basis, we derive and validate the essential relationship between the local and global popularities and then propose an unsupervised recurrent federated learning (URFL) algorithm to predict the distributed popularity while achieving privacy preservation and unsupervised training. Moreover, a federated loss-weighted averaging (FedLWA) scheme for the parameter aggregation is further designed to alleviate the problem of noni.i.d. user behaviors. Simulations indicate that the proposed framework can enhance the prediction accuracy in terms of a reduced root-mean-squared error by up to 60.5%-68.7% compared to other baseline methods, i.e., recommendation algo- rithms, centralized learning algorithms, and other distributed learning algorithms. Additionally, manual labeling and violation of users' data privacy are both avoided.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS
AB Federated learning does well in jointly training multiple deep learning models for fault diagnosis. The accuracy of local model may affect the effectiveness of federated learning. In the case when the local model is suffered from few labeled data with poor quality, it is significant to design an active federation strategy to screen informative unlabeled samples by which supervised model can be further optimized. However, traditional active learning method for federated learning is unable to guarantee the effectiveness of federation since it focuses on screening the samples helpful for a specific local model rather than global model. This paper proposes a method of combining the variability of informativeness within the client and the variability between clients to overcome this problem. Informativeness variability of labeled data between clients is used to guide the screen strategy using active federation model rather than local model, such that influence of unreliable clients can be decreased to avoid negative transferring due to samples with low quality. Experimental validation for benchmark dataset of rolling bearing shows that 25.04% improvement of fault diagnosis accuracy can be achieved in the case when only few labeled data are available and 13.6% improvement can be achieved in the case when only labeled data with low quality are available.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Deploying deep learning models on edge servers can effectively alleviate the pressure on cloud data centers in computing, communication, and energy, etc. In this study, we attempt to extend this deployment scheme from edge servers to mobile terminals to further save spectrum resources, utilize communication resources, and provide intelligent applications. Unfortunately, the learning model experiences a slow convergence speed, and the mobile terminal consumes much energy if the model is only trained on the local devices with weak computing power. Therefore, we deploy deep learning algorithms (both in edge servers and mobile terminals) by considering the delay and energy consumption constraints of terminals in task processing. Specifically, a lightweight federated learning model is first proposed through the cooperative training between edge servers and mobile terminals. The trained model is then migrated to mobile terminals. Finally, image identification is considered to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed model. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the model reaches 90% using two datasets and three network models. In addition, it further reduces the processing delay and saves energy.

AB With the fast development of artificial intelligence (AI) and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies, it is challenging to deal with the problems of data privacy protection and secure computing. In recent years, federated learning (FL) is proposed to attack the challenges of learning shared models collaboratively while protecting security based on the data from cross-domain clients. However, data in the real environment is usually not independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) due to the differences in business, working environments, and data acquisition, and thus classic federated methods suffer from significant performance degradation. In this paper, a novel federated framework is proposed for secure textile fiber identification (FedTFI) via cross-domain texture representation based on high-definition fabric images. In addition to sharing the gradient of FedTFI, the local patch of feature maps between cross-domain clients is randomly exchanged to build a richer image texture feature distribution while protecting data security simultaneously for secure computing. Furthermore, a texture embedding layer is designed to provide a joint representation through similarity measure between triplet samples in low-dimensional space. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, two textile image datasets, i.e., one public and the other we collected, are utilized to construct four Non-IID scenarios, including label skew, feature skew, and two combined skew scenarios. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our model to obtain better detection accuracies than benchmarks in four Non-IID scenarios by keeping data privacy for secure computing in fabric IIoT.

TI Federated Learning for UAVs-Enabled Wireless Networks: Use Cases,

ID MOBILE
AB The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for wireless networks is rapidly growing as key enablers of new applications, including: surveillance and monitoring, military, delivery of medical supplies, telecommunications, etc. In particular, due to their unique proprieties such as flexibility, mobility, and adaptive altitude, UAVs can act as mobile base stations to improve capacity, coverage, and energy efficiency of wireless networks. On the other hand, UAVs can operate as mobile terminals to enable many applications such as item delivery and real-time video streaming. In such context, data-driven Deep Learning-assisted (DL) approaches are gaining a growing interest to not only exploit the huge amount of generated data, but also to optimize the network operations, and hence ensure the QoS requirements of these emerging wireless networks. However, UAVs are resource-constrained devices especially in terms of computing and power resources, and traditional DL-assisted schemes are cloud-centric, which require UAVs' data to be sent and stored in a centralized server. This represents a critical issue since it generates a huge network communication overhead to send raw data towards the centralized entity, and hence may lead to network bandwidth and energy inefficiency of UAV devices. In addition, the transferred data may contain personnel data such as UAVs' localization and identity, which can directly affect UAVs' privacy concerns. As a solution, Federated Deep Learning (FDL), or distributed DL, was introduced, where the basic idea is to keep raw data where it is generated, while sending only users' local trained DL models to the centralized entity for aggregation. Due to its privacy-preserving and low communication overhead and latency, FDL is much more adequate for many UAVs-enabled wireless applications. In this work, we provide a general introduction of FDL application for UAV-enabled wireless networks. We first introduce the FDL concept and its fundamentals. Then, we highlight the possible applications of FDL in UAVs-enabled wireless networks by addressing the suitability and how to use FDL to deal with target challenges. Finally, we discuss about key technical challenges, open issues, and future research directions on FDL-based approaches in such context.

AB Driven by privacy concerns and the visions of deep learning, the last four years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the applicability mechanism of machine learning (ML). An emerging model, called federated learning (FL), is rising above both centralized systems and on-site analysis, to be a new fashioned design for ML implementation. It is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach, which keeps raw data on devices and involves local ML training while eliminating data communication overhead. A federation of the learned and shared models is then performed on a central server to aggregate and share the built knowledge among participants. This article starts by examining and comparing different ML-based deployment architectures, followed by in-depth and in-breadth investigation on FL. Compared to the existing reviews in the field, we provide in this survey a new classification of FL topics and research fields based on thorough analysis of the main technical challenges and current related work. In this context, we elaborate comprehensive taxonomies covering various challenging aspects, contributions, and trends in the literature, including core system models and designs, application areas, privacy and security, and resource management. Furthermore, we discuss important challenges and open research directions toward more robust FL systems.

AB Decentralized multi-client functional encryption for inner product (DMCFE-IP) enables efficient joint functional computation of private inputs in a secure manner without a trusted third party, which has found successful applications, including distributed statistical analysis and machine learning. However, existing DMCFE-IP schemes suffer several drawbacks, such as lack of support for client dropout, requiring cross-client communication for key generation, and poor efficiency and scalability. To address these issues, we propose an efficient and scalable DMCFE-IP, which supports client dropout and non-interactive decentralized partial decryption key generation. Our scheme mainly exploits appropriate underlying cryptographic primitives, including multi-client functional encryption, digital signature, key agreement, secret sharing, and symmetric encryption, with careful integration to achieve the aforementioned two functionalities. We then extend this scheme to enable privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) for the cross-silo scenrio. We provide formal security proof for our scheme and evaluate our DMCFE-IP-based PPFL on several real-world datasets. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves a speedup of 6.12$\sim$similar to 43.36x in running time.

AB With the widespread application of Internet of Things (IoT), its energy consumption is becoming a major concern. Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple low-power devices to collaboratively learn a shared model, which reduces the energy consumption of IoT systems. However, FL involves highly varied data structures and require large amounts of communication. The communication efficiency greatly affects the system performance. In this paper, we optimize communication efficiency in the device access layer. Considering the instability of IoT device network connections, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based Efficient Access Scheduling Algorithm (DRL-EASA). It can adapt to changes in IoT device numbers and densities and thus applicable to instantaneous dynamic FL IoT systems. In scale-changed scenarios, DRL-EASA constructs geospatial-oriented state spaces and utilizes learning algorithm to train access scheduling strategies, effectively decoupling device numbers from the algorithm's network structure. Firstly, the geographic region is divided into grids and the User State Information (USI) is mapped into fixed-dimensional Geographic State Information Vectors (GSIV). Secondly, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used as an agent to extract interference feature information from GSIV, and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is utilized to train the agent. Finally, a random algorithm is employed to assist DRL in generating scheduling decisions, enhancing the algorithm's generalization performance in high device density scenarios. Numerical results show that our approach optimizes access scheduling strategies for both uplink and downlink and demonstrates effective adaptability to dynamically changing device numbers and exhibits strong generalization performance across various device densities.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm in the Internet of Things (IoT), which allows multiple devices to collaboratively train models without leaking local data. In the open scenario of IoT, malicious devices can launch poisoning attacks to compromise the final model by submitting crafted gradients. Some previous studies defend against poisoning attacks by analyzing the statistical characteristics of plaintext gradients. However, plaintext gradients would expose private information to malicious FL devices or servers. To simultaneously resist poisoning attacks and preserve privacy, cryptography technology can be utilized to obfuscate the gradients in defense methods, but the private calculation of resisting poisoning attack methods will cause efficiency problems, especially imposing unaffordable overhead on resource-limited IoT devices. Therefore, resisting poisoning attacks efficiently while protecting privacy remains a challenge. This article proposes a secure and privacy-enhanced FL (SPEFL) framework for efficient privacy-preserving and poisoning-resistant FL in IoT. We design an efficient secure computation protocol based on a three-server architecture to facilitate the cryptographic computation of large linear and complex nonlinear operators in the method against poisoning attacks. In SPEFL, most of the calculations are efficiently performed on the servers, which will not impose too much burden on resource-limited IoT devices. In addition, we design a security-enhanced verifiable protocol to detect the malicious behavior of the server and guarantee the correctness of FL aggregation results. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that SPEFL can efficiently complete FL training meanwhile guaranteeing the accuracy of the model.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities are flourishing with distributed systems in mobile wireless networks. As a result, an enormous amount of data are being generated for devices at the network edge. This results in privacy concerns, sensor data management issues, and data utilization issues. In this research, we propose a collaborative clustering method where the exchange of raw data is not required. The attention-based model used with a federated learning framework. The edge devices compute the model updates using local data and send them to the server for aggregation. Repetition is performed in multiple rounds until a convergence point reached. The transaction data used to train the attention model that gives a low dimensional embedding. Afterwards, we share the convergence model among the client/stores. Then, efficient pattern mining methods known as a clustering-based dynamic method (CBDM) are applied. For experimentation, we used retail store data to cluster the customer based on purchase behaviour. The proposed clustering method used semantic embedding to extract and then cluster them by discovering relevant patterns. The method achieved the 0.75 ROC values for the random distribution and 0.70 for the fixed distribution. The clustering method can help to reduce communication costs while ensuring privacy.

AB Recent years have witnessed the development of federated learning (FL) that allows wireless devices (WDs) to collaboratively learn a global model under the coordination of a parameter server without sharing their local datasets. To meet the communication efficiency and privacy requirements, over-the-air computation and differential privacy (DP) have been incorporated in FL by leveraging the signal-superposition property of multiple-access channels and using artificial noises to perturb local model updates, thereby preserving DP. In this paper, we propose an exploration into device sampling with replacement as a potential mechanism for augmenting the DP levels of WDs in over-the-air FL. In particular, we delve into the joint optimization of device sampling strategy, the number of training rounds, and over-the-air transceiver design. Our goal is to maximize the learning performance while ensuring each WD meets the DP requirement. The problem is challenging due to the intractable FL convergence rate and privacy losses under random sampling, coupled with the strong interconnection among mixed continuous and integer decision variables. To tackle this problem, we first analyze the learning convergence rate and privacy losses of WDs. The analysis allows us to derive the optimal transceiver design per round in closed forms. Then, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm by deriving the optimal device sampling strategy and the number of training rounds in semi-closed forms. Our numerical results, based on real-world learning tasks, showcase the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with representative baselines.

AB Device fingerprinting combined with Machine and Deep Learning (ML/DL) report promising performance when detecting spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks. However, the amount of data needed to train models and the scenario privacy concerns limit the applicability of centralized ML/DL. Federated learning (FL) addresses these drawbacks but is vulnerable to adversarial participants and attacks. The literature has proposed countermeasures, but more effort is required to evaluate the performance of FL detecting SSDF attacks and their robustness against adversaries. Thus, the first contribution of this work is to create an FL-oriented dataset modeling the behavior of resource-constrained spectrum sensors affected by SSDF attacks. The second contribution is a pool of experiments analyzing the robustness of FL models according to i) three families of sensors, ii) eight SSDF attacks, iii) four FL scenarios dealing with anomaly detection and binary classification, iv) up to 33% of participants implementing data and model poisoning attacks, and v) four aggregation functions acting as anti-adversarial mechanisms. In conclusion, FL achieves promising performance when detecting SSDF attacks. Without anti-adversarial mechanisms, FL models are particularly vulnerable with >16% of adversaries. Coordinate-wise-median is the best mitigation for anomaly detection, but binary classifiers are still affected with >33% of adversaries.

AB In federated learning (FL), devices contribute to global training by uploading only the local model gradients (outcomes), providing connected devices with the ability to learn while preserving privacy. FL-based resource allocation for V2X communications is proposed, referred to as FL-RA-V2X, which optimizes and maximizes the throughput of all vehicle users within the constraints of maximum power and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). It ensures fairness in resource allocation, meeting the minimum SINR requirements for cellular users and outage probability constraints for vehicle users. An approximate expression for vehicle users' throughput is derived, eliminating the non-convexity associated with the SINR expression through iterative calculations of auxiliary variables. The resource allocation is designed to allow each vehicle user to share uplink resources with cellular users, maximizing the number of vehicle users while utilizing their maximum power transmission capability. Simulation results demonstrate the fairness and enhanced throughput efficiency of the proposed approach compared to contemporary algorithms, considering vehicle outage ratio, computational complexity, computing time, maximum transmitting power, cumulative distribution function of achievable sum rates, and convergence metrics. Furthermore, the proposed approach addresses critical aspects, including high mobility and distributed V2V communications, asynchronous training issues in cellular V2X networks, and the convergence analysis under different conditions such as varied vehicle densities and mobility patterns. These considerations broaden the applicability and robustness of the FL-RA-V2X method across diverse scenarios. The analysis also explores the impact of vehicle speed, auxiliary variables, interference effects of cellular users, and the dependence of throughput on FL iterations.

AB Local differential privacy federated learning (LDP-FL) is a framework to achieve high local data privacy protection while training the model in a decentralized environment. Currently, LDP-FL's trainings are suffering from efficiency problems due to many existing researches combine LDP and FL without looking deep into the relationships between the two most important parameters, i.e., privacy budget for privacy protection and gradients for model training. In this work, we propose a novel LDP-FL under multi-privacy regimes to combat the above problems. Firstly, unlike the existing multiple privacy regimes-based LDP-FL to compute the non -unbiased global gradient, we propose an unbiased mean estimator using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to obtain small variance global gradients with a higher training accuracy. Secondly, to improve the efficiency of model training for multi-privacy scenarios, we design two different dynamic privacy budget allocation approaches for users to choose from. The first approach allocates the privacy budget based on the training model's accuracy, and the second approach's privacy budget grows linearly, avoiding the computational effort caused by the comparison operation. Finally, since directly perturbing the high-dimensional local gradients in traditional methods would lead to considerable utility loss, we propose a layered dimension selection strategy by randomly selecting the layers of gradients that take part in the noise perturbation while others remain untouched. In simulations using the handwritten MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, we compare our framework with the traditional LDP-FL, simple personalized mean estimation (S-PME), and PLU-FedOA. The results demonstrate the training efficiency of our framework.

AB The global pandemic of COVID-19 has had profound and devastating effects on human life since its emergence in 2019. This viral infection predominantly impacts the respiratory system, causing a range of severity in alveolar overlapping that results in breathlessness and fatality. A novel methodology was assessed using the primary COVID-19 dataset from Kaggle, employing a federated learning ecosystem with multi-user datasets. This technique involves extracting data logs from various user repositories and datasets within the federated learning framework. Subsequently, a validation process is conducted, followed by computation utilizing a deep feature set categorization technique augmented by artificial intelligence. This augmented intelligence is showcased in a multi-layer image classification system designed for feature recognition and extraction. The training dataset, comprising 1056 data samples, is split into 647 for training and 409 for testing. Experimental outcomes highlighted a more comprehensive mapping and prioritization of features relative to attribute values. Remarkably, the proposed classification technique surpasses existing methods in accurately labeling COVID-19 detection as opposed to pneumonia and normal lung conditions in MRI/CT images.

ID PLACEMENT
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have proven to be useful in a variety of applications, including aerial base station relay. UAVs can be used to relay network access from the air to user equipment (UE) on the ground. To improve the quality of experience (QoE) provided by UAVs, proactive content frequently requested by UEs can be cached to the UAVs. However, it is difficult to predict the chaotic and nonstationary patterns of mobile UEs because of the QoE requirements, the frequent location changes, the delays in content delivery, and scalability issues. Thus, this paper proposes a novel Deep Federated Echo State Learning (DeepFESL) content caching scheme to predict popular content requests and mobility patterns, using the context information of UEs, such as device type, location, and other behaviors on the device. The adverse effects of training models with such sensitive data make it inevitable to consider the privacy issues related to using such data. As a result, the proposed DeepFESL scheme employs a decentralized technique, federated learning to collaboratively train shared models on UEs' devices, where shared weights are aggregated at the control server. Popular contents are cached at the UAVs, where the UAVs form associations with the UEs in clusters based on predictions of the mobility patterns of the UEs. Experiment results show that our proposed DeepFESL scheme outperforms existing schemes in predicting popular UE contents and locations, increasing cache hit rate and cache utilization, reducing content transmission delays, and improving UEs' QoE.

ID BLOCKCHAIN; FRAMEWORK
AB The sharing of flight operation data brings huge benefits to all participants, but for the privacy protection and data security, it is difficult to directly share flight operation data. Federated learning (FL) enables participants to jointly train machine learning models without exposing local data. However, due to the centralization of FL and the unreliability of FL participants, FL is vulnerable to malicious client and server attacks. In this paper, an anti-poisoning attack decentralized privacy enhanced federated learning (APDPFL) scheme is designed to mitigate the impact of server and malicious clients. Specifically, a local R & eacute;nyi differential privacy is designed to protect client data privacy. Then, a verification method based on K-Means clustering is proposed to select models to participate in aggregation, which improves the anti-poisoning attack performance. Finally, a federated grouping practical Byzantine fault tolerance (FGPBFT) consensus algorithm based on consortium blockchain is proposed to dynamically change server and consensus clients, to decentralize server and improve the consensus efficiency. The theoretical analysis proves that the APDPFL achieves better convergence and provides data privacy protection and security protection. The experimental results on public datasets and flight operation datasets show that the APDPFL is robust and effective for sharing flight operation data.

ID GEARBOX
AB Federated learning (FL), dedicated to ensuring interclient data privacy and leveraging the private data among clients to collectively train global models, has seen widespread research in gearbox fault diagnosis in recent years. However, in gearbox fault diagnosis, various clients typically exhibit imbalanced distributions of labels, resulting in data label distribution skew across clients, which poses a challenge to achieving convergence of the global model. Moreover, it is difficult for the global model to adapt to the personalized fault diagnosis requirements of different gearboxes. To this end, this study proposes a class information-guided personalized FL (CIGPFL) for gearbox fault diagnosis. To provide personalized diagnostic requirements for different gearbox clients, a generic layer robust feature optimization strategy and a class prototype-guided personalized layer strategy are designed in this framework. In addition, within this framework, local class information orthogonal constraint (CIOC) loss is used to mitigate the negative impact of label distribution skew. Extensive experiments are conducted on the drivetrain diagnostics simulator (DDS) dataset, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our approach.

ID CHEMICAL WARFARE AGENTS; NETWORKS
AB Chemical agents are one of the major threats to soldiers in modern warfare, so it is so important to detect chemical agents rapidly and accurately on battlefields. Raman spectroscopy-based detectors are widely used but have many limitations. The Raman spectrum changes unpredictably due to various environmental factors, and it is hard for detectors to make appropriate judgments about new chemical substances without prior information. Thus, the existing detectors with inflexible techniques based on determined rules cannot deal with such problems flexibly and reactively. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based detection techniques can be good alternatives to the existing techniques for chemical agent detection. To build AI-based detection systems, sufficient amounts of data for training are required, but it is not easy to produce and handle fatal chemical agents, which causes difficulty in securing data in advance. To overcome the limitations, in this paper, we propose the distributed Raman spectrum data augmentation system that leverages federated learning (FL) with deep generative models, such as generative adversarial network (GAN) and autoencoder. Furthermore, the proposed system utilizes various additional techniques in combination to generate a large number of Raman spectrum data with reality along with diversity. We implemented the proposed system and conducted diverse experiments to evaluate the system. The evaluation results validated that the proposed system can train the models more quickly through cooperation among decentralized troops without exchanging raw data and generate realistic Raman spectrum data well. Moreover, we confirmed that the classification model on the proposed system performed learning much faster and outperformed the existing systems.

AB Federated learning is an emerging paradigm allowing large-scale decentralized learning without sharing data across different data owners, which helps address the concern of data privacy in medical image analysis. However, the requirement for label consistency across clients by the existing methods largely narrows its application scope. In practice, each clinical site may only annotate certain organs of interest with partial or no overlap with other sites. Incorporating such partially labeled data into a unified federation is an unexplored problem with clinical significance and urgency. This work tackles the challenge by using a novel federated multi-encoding U-Net (Fed-MENU) method for multi-organ segmentation. In our method, a multi-encoding U-Net (MENU-Net) is proposed to extract organ-specific features through different encoding sub-networks. Each sub-network can be seen as an expert of a specific organ and trained for that client. Moreover, to encourage the organ-specific features extracted by different sub-networks to be informative and distinctive, we regularize the training of the MENU-Net by designing an auxiliary generic decoder (AGD). Extensive experiments on six public abdominal CT datasets show that our Fed-MENU method can effectively obtain a federated learning model using the partially labeled datasets with superior performance to other models trained by either localized or centralized learning methods. Source code is publicly available at https://github.com/DIAL-RPI/Fed-MENU.

AB This paper studies the joint device selection and power control scheme for wireless federated learning (FL), considering both the downlink and uplink communications between the parameter server (PS) and the terminal devices. In each round of model training, the PS first broadcasts the global model to the terminal devices in an analog fashion, and then the terminal devices perform local training and upload the updated model parameters to the PS via over-the-air computation (AirComp). First, we propose an AirComp-based adaptive reweighing scheme for the aggregation of local updated models, where the model aggregation weights are directly determined by the uplink transmit power values of the selected devices and which enables the joint learning and communication optimization simply by the device selection and power control. Furthermore, we provide a convergence analysis for the proposed wireless FL algorithm and the upper bound on the expected optimality gap between the expected and optimal global loss values is derived. With instantaneous channel state information (CSI), we formulate the optimality gap minimization problems under both the individual and sum uplink transmit power constraints, respectively, which are shown to be solved by the semidefinite programming (SDR) technique. Numerical results reveal that our proposed wireless FL algorithm achieves close to the best performance by using the ideal FedAvg scheme with error-free model exchange and full device participation.

AB Big data produced by Internet of Things (IoT) devices is the key drive for prognostic and health management (PHM) for industrial equipment or systems. However, data are usually distributed stored in many scenarios due to security and privacy problems. Federated learning (FL) is an effective solution to fuse the data for intelligent decision. But FL faces risk of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack or single-point-of-failure (SPOF) problem during training and service phases, and exchange of model parameters poses heavy network traffic between clients. Ensemble learning (EL) is widely used to boost task performance by combining diverse base learners, and it has shown promise in improving distributed intelligent services. Since a decision is collaboratively made by multiple clients in EL in a distributed fashion, DoS and SPOF problem can be inherently avoided, and the deployment cost is much lower than FL. Based on these good properties, we proposed to combine FL and EL for distributed IoT data fusion with a cognitive approach. First, we propose to construct effective EL by generating diverse base models with advanced pruning method and compare the performance of FL- and EL-based distributed data fusion. Then, a hierarchical combination of FL and EL is proposed based on the cognition of cost and performance at each level for efficient deployment of distributed IoT data fusion. Experimental results show that the EL-based scheme can achieve close performance to the FL-based scheme for small number of clients with some data sharing, and the cognitive hierarchical combination of FL and EL can achieve a good tradeoff between task performance and network traffic for large-scale distributed IoT data fusion.

AB The sheer unpredictability of content popularity, diversified user preferences and demands, and privacy concerns for data sharing all create hurdles to develop proactive content caching strategies in self-driving cars. Therefore, to address these concerns, we investigate in detail the role of proactive content caching methods in self-driving cars for improving quality-of-experience (QoE) and content retrieval cost in this work. We develop a low-complexity content popularity prediction mechanism in a hierarchical federated setting. In particular, we use a self-attention technique with an LSTM-based prediction mechanism to extract local content popularity patterns in self-driving cars. However, the local contents will not be sufficient to satisfy the passenger's requirements. Hence, using the popular contents of other self-driving cars will solve the requirement constraint but poses some privacy issues. We use the privacy-preserving decentralized model training framework of Federated Learning (FL) to tackle this issue. Specifically, we deploy the hierarchical Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm on local models obtained from self-driving cars to develop a regional and global content popularity prediction model at RSU and MBS, respectively. Extensive simulations on real-world datasets show the proposed approach improves cache space utilization by maximizing the local cache hit ratio, and further, minimizes the content retrieval cost for self-driving cars as compared with alternative methods.

ID DISTRIBUTED OPTIMIZATION
AB A novel algorithm is proposed for highly privacy-preserving decentralized federated learning (FL). Several studies have reported security risks in decentralized FL by reconstructing data even from model update differences. A common approach to overcome this issue is to use the diffusion process following differential privacy (DP), i.e., message passing between nodes is hidden by noise. However, this often makes the learning process unstable, leading to degraded results compared to without using DP diffusion process. In this paper, we propose a primal-dual DP algorithm with denoising normalization (DP-Norm) for less sensitivity to noise/interference, such as DP diffusion and heterogeneous data allocation. For DP-Norm, privacy analysis to determine minimal noise level and convergence analysis are conducted. Through image classification benchmark tests, we confirmed that DP-Norm performed close to the single-node reference score, even when statistically heterogeneous data was allocated on six nodes.

TI Federated Social Recommendation with Graph Neural Network

DT Article
DE Federated learning; recommender system; social recommendation; graph
   neural network
AB Recommender systems have become prosperous nowadays, designed to predict users' potential interests in items by learning embeddings. Recent developments of the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) also provide recommender systems (RSs) with powerful backbones to learn embeddings from a user-item graph. However, only leveraging the user-item interactions suffers from the cold-start issue due to the difficulty in data collection. Hence, current endeavors propose fusing social information with user-item interactions to alleviate it, which is the social recommendation problem. Existing work employs GNNs to aggregate both social links and user-item interactions simultaneously. However, they all require centralized storage of the social links and item interactions of users, which leads to privacy concerns. Additionally, according to strict privacy protection under General Data Protection Regulation, centralized data storage may not be feasible in the future, urging a decentralized framework of social recommendation.
   As a result, we design a federated learning recommender system for the social recommendation task, which is rather challenging because of its heterogeneity, personalization, and privacy protection requirements. To this end, we devise a novel framework Fedrated Social recommendation with Graph neural network (FeSoG). Firstly, FeSoG adopts relational attention and aggregation to handle heterogeneity. Secondly, FeSoG infers user embeddings using local data to retain personalization. Last but not least, the proposed model employs pseudo-labeling techniques with item sampling to protect the privacy and enhance training. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets justify the effectiveness of FeSoG in completing social recommendation and privacy protection. We are the first work proposing a federated learning framework for social recommendation to the best of our knowledge.

AB Secure and trusted cross-platform knowledge sharing is significant for modern intelligent data analysis. To address the trade-off problems between privacy and utility in complex federated learning, a novel differentially private federated learning framework is proposed. First, the impact of data heterogeneity of participants on global model accuracy is analyzed quantitatively based on 1-Wasserstein distance. Then, we design a multilevel and multiparticipant dynamic allocation method of privacy budget to reduce the injected noise, and the utility can be improved efficiently. Finally, they are integrated, and a novel adaptive differentially private federated learning algorithm (A-DPFL) is designed. Comprehensive experiments on redefined non-I.I.D MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets are conducted, and the results demonstrate the superiority of model accuracy, convergence, and robustness.

ID MECHANISM
AB Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) utilizes multiple zero-day vulnerabilities to threaten critical industrial infrastructure, having the characteristics of burst, unknown and cross-domain. To resist APT attacks, existing wisdom usually establish a security monitoring platform that remotely links to the cloud-based threat intelligence center. However, the real scenario where few victim users are willing to share raw attack samples considering privacy-preservation, such mentality is hysteretic and cannot identify APT attacks quickly without sacrificing additional incentives. To address this issue, a novel privacy-preserving few-shot traffic detection (PFTD) method based on federated meta learning (FML) is proposed. The PFTD treats the APT detection task as a model generalization optimization process, that transfers the learned knowledge to identify local unknown samples. Client-side models in FML achieve knowledge transferring by two-phase updating over both support dataset and query dataset, while the server-side model obtains global knowledge with model aggregation. These processes compile useful knowledge against APT attacks. With a novel wisdom, we obtained three advantages: 1) High accuracy with a few attack samples; 2) Low latency detection for removing rules matching process; 3) High personalizing to cross-domain APT attacks. Extensive experiments based on multiple benchmark datasets like CICIDS2017 and DAPT 2020 prove the superiority of proposed PFTD.

DE Federated learning; Recommendation systems; Multi-view framework;
   Feature rescaling; Data privacy
AB As big data technologies continue to evolve, recommendation systems have found broad application in domains such as online retail and social networking platforms. However, centralized recommendation systems raise numerous data privacy concerns. Federated learning addresses these concerns by allowing model training on client devices and aggregating model parameters without sharing raw data. Nevertheless, federated learning faces critical challenges related to feature extraction efficiency and noise sensitivity, limiting its application in e-commerce recommendation systems where data heterogeneity and high-dimensional features are prevalent. To address these gaps, this paper introduces a novel multi-view federated learning framework, Fed-FR-MVD, designed to enhance feature extraction efficiency and improve recommendation accuracy in e-commerce applications. Fed-FR-MVD integrates a FR mechanism within a multi-view structure, incorporating both item and user perspectives to improve feature representation and robustness. This approach yields a 12%-18% increase in recommendation accuracy across various performance metrics compared to single-view and other multi-view methods. By addressing data heterogeneity and optimizing feature utilization through dynamic rescaling, Fed-FR-MVD effectively mitigates the impact of noisy data, with performance maintained across noise levels of 5%-15%. Experimental results demonstrate that Fed-FR-MVD fills a key research gap by providing a more resilient and efficient framework for federated recommendation systems in privacy-sensitive and data-diverse e-commerce environments.

AB This paper proposes a vehicular edge federated learning (VEFL) solution, where an edge server leverages highly mobile connected vehicles' (CVs') onboard central processing units (CPUs) and local datasets to train a global model. Convergence analysis reveals that the VEFL training loss depends on the successful receptions of the CVs' trained models over the intermittent vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) wireless links. Owing to high mobility, in the full device participation case (FDPC), the edge server aggregates client model parameters based on a weighted combination according to the CVs' dataset sizes and sojourn periods, while it selects a subset of CVs in the partial device participation case (PDPC). We then devise joint VEFL and radio access technology (RAT) parameters optimization problems under delay, energy and cost constraints to maximize the probability of successful reception of the locally trained models. Considering that the optimization problem is NP-hard, we decompose it into a VEFL parameter optimization sub-problem, given the estimated worst-case sojourn period, delay and energy expense, and an online RAT parameter optimization sub-problem. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions with a practical 5G new radio (5G-NR) RAT under a realistic microscopic mobility model.

AB Home appliance manufacturers strive to obtain feedback from users to improve their products and services to build a smart home system. To help manufacturers develop a smart home system, we design a federated learning (FL) system leveraging a reputation mechanism to assist home appliance manufacturers to train a machine learning model based on customers' data. Then, manufacturers can predict customers' requirements and consumption behaviors in the future. The working flow of the system includes two stages: in the first stage, customers train the initial model provided by the manufacturer using both the mobile phone and the mobile-edge computing (MEC) server. Customers collect data from various home appliances using phones, and then they download and train the initial model with their local data. After deriving local models, customers sign on their models and send them to the blockchain. In case customers or manufacturers are malicious, we use the blockchain to replace the centralized aggregator in the traditional FL system. Since records on the blockchain are untampered, malicious customers or manufacturers' activities are traceable. In the second stage, manufacturers select customers or organizations as miners for calculating the averaged model using received models from customers. By the end of the crowdsourcing task, one of the miners, who is selected as the temporary leader, uploads the model to the blockchain. To protect customers' privacy and improve the test accuracy, we enforce differential privacy (DP) on the extracted features and propose a new normalization technique. We experimentally demonstrate that our normalization technique outperforms batch normalization when features are under DP protection. In addition, to attract more customers to participate in the crowdsourcing FL task, we design an incentive mechanism to award participants.

   cost-effective video surveillance management system
AB Video surveillance systems are integral to bolstering safety and security across multiple settings. With the advent of deep learning (DL), a specialization within machine learning (ML), these systems have been significantly augmented to facilitate DL-based video surveillance services with notable precision. Nevertheless, DL-based video surveillance services, which necessitate the tracking of object movement and motion tracking (e.g., to identify unusual object behaviors), can demand a significant portion of computational and memory resources. This includes utilizing GPU computing power for model inference and allocating GPU memory for model loading. To tackle the computational demands inherent in DL-based video surveillance, this study introduces a novel video surveillance management system designed to optimize operational efficiency. At its core, the system is built on a two-tiered edge computing architecture (i.e., client and server through socket transmission). In this architecture, the primary edge (i.e., client side) handles the initial processing tasks, such as object detection, and is connected via a Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable to the Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) camera, directly at the source of the video feed. This immediate processing reduces the latency of data transfer by detecting objects in real time. Meanwhile, the secondary edge (i.e., server side) plays a vital role by hosting a dynamically controlling threshold module targeted at releasing DL-based models, reducing needless GPU usage. This module is a novel addition that dynamically adjusts the threshold time value required to release DL models. By dynamically optimizing this threshold, the system can effectively manage GPU usage, ensuring resources are allocated efficiently. Moreover, we utilize federated learning (FL) to streamline the training of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for predicting imminent object appearances by amalgamating data from diverse camera sources while ensuring data privacy and optimized resource allocation. Furthermore, in contrast to the static threshold values or moving average techniques used in previous approaches for the controlling threshold module, we employ a Deep Q-Network (DQN) methodology to manage threshold values dynamically. This approach efficiently balances the trade-off between GPU memory conservation and the reloading latency of the DL model, which is enabled by incorporating LSTM-derived predictions as inputs to determine the optimal timing for releasing the DL model. The results highlight the potential of our approach to significantly improve the efficiency and effective usage of computational resources in video surveillance systems, opening the door to enhanced security in various domains.

AB The vehicle-road cooperation system (VRCS) facilitates vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication for future vehicle usage in sixth generation (6G) networks. The implementation of the 6G network has made it possible for V2V communication to enhance network density, optimize transmission mode selection, and offer connectivity between vehicles while guaranteeing Quality of Service (QoS). However, there are inherent challenges, such as limited bandwidth, diverse QoS requirements, interference, and power constraints, associated with resource allocation and mode selection in V2V and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. In this article, we jointly optimized the mode selection and resource allocation problems in VRCS by using simultaneous transmission and reflection-reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). The proposed model utilizes quantum federated reinforcement-learning (QFRL)-based augmented intelligence algorithms within the STAR-RIS VRCS framework. The proposed QFRL algorithm is a promising solution for advanced decision making, automation to improve traffic flow, reduces traffic congestion, and improve safety in the STAR-RIS assisted VRCS. Additionally, by leveraging the unique processing advantage of quantum computing will make the VRCS more capable of handling the enormous amount of real-time data that IoT devices send, which is necessary for the intelligent services it offers. The proposed model QFRL-based STAR-RIS assisted VRCS approach maximizes vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) user capacity while meeting the reliability requirement of V2V pairs. Finally, the simulation results prove the superiority of the QFRL algorithm against baseline schemes like quantum federated learning (QFL), federated reinforcement learning (FRL), and federated learning (FL) algorithms for V2V pairs. Furthermore, the performance evaluation findings indicate that the proposed STAR-RIS assisted QFRL algorithm performs 20.5%, 32.2%, and 46.7% better than QFL, FRL, and FL.

AB Social manufacturing leverages the power of social networks and collaborative processes to enhance manufacturing capabilities and supports the sharing of ideas, resources, and information. However, traditional remote maintenance under a social manufacturing context lacks resilience against disruptions and cyber attacks. These issues often lead to interruptions in production. This article proposed blockchain-of-things-based edge learning contracts for federated predictive maintenance (FPM). First, given the diversity and heterogeneity of equipment, an open platform communication unified architecture (OPCUA)-based equipment meta-model is proposed to facilitate the interconnection and data sharing. Second, a Blockchain-of-Things-based secure access control approach is proposed, to directly collect data from controllers. This approach prevents tampering, unlike traditional local database collection methods. Third, to address the security and efficiency needs, an edge learning contract method is proposed for FPM. An integrated learning algorithm based on smart contracts is designed to achieve prediction performance that is comparable to local centralized training while reducing data transmission load and enhancing data security. Finally, a federated predictive maintenance platform is designed and implemented to enhance the system's resilience, and its effectiveness is verified through case studies.

AB Network intrusion detection methods based on federated learning (FL) and edge computing have great potential for protecting the cybersecurity of the Internet of Things. It overcomes the disadvantages of the traditional centralized method, such as high latency, overloaded network, and privacy leakage. At the same time, it can combine private data from multiple participants to train models, and the rich data can train more effective models. However, the inherent security vulnerabilities of the FL framework do not ensure the robustness of the global models trained collaboratively. Towards FL, each participant has access to model parameters and training data, and malicious participants can affect the global model by tampering with data or weights. This paper studies label-flipping attacks in FL-based IoT intrusion detection. We propose a lightweight detection mechanism to mitigate the impact of poisoning attacks on FL-based intrusion detection methods in IoT networks. The detection mechanism on a central server filters anomalous participants and excludes their uploaded models from the global model aggregation. Specifically, we propose a scoring mechanism for evaluating participants based on the loss of the local model and the training dataset size. Afterwards, the Manhattan similarity between each participant will be calculated according to the scores. Finally, the anomalous participants will be found by clustering algo-rithm for similarity cluster analysis. The experimental results show that our proposed detection method can defend against label-flipping attacks in FL. On the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset, our method can improve the accuracy of the intrusion detection model trained based on FL from 84.3% to 97.1%, while enhancing the protection of IoT network security. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background and Objective: Healthcare institutions produce and retain a considerable amount of healthassociated information about patients, thus providing great potential for medical applications based on machine learning that may use such data to address healthcare problems. However, accessing or disseminating patients' data beyond the confines of the host institution is frequently hampered by multiple factors, such as privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) data systems have been posited as a potential solution to the challenges related to the segregated nature of health data and the hurdles in data exchange. However, although FL addresses privacy concerns related to healthcare data, in real settings, the non-stationary and the non -uniform data distribution affect the performance of ML models. This paper aims to evaluate how these issues directly impact the quality of the estimated performance of a federated neural network model in the e -health domain. Methods: This work extends a time series-based classification problem from a traditional centralized scenario into a federated one under the hypothesis of non-stationary and non -uniform data distribution, also called heterogeneous data distribution. Results: The assessment of the proposed method's effectiveness is conducted by measuring Precision, Recall, Accuracy and F1 -Score, and it is compared with an FL approach working under the hypothesis of stationary data. The experimental evaluation reports performance results with an accuracy and precision of over 0.91, as in the case of stationary data. Conclusion: The results show that heterogeneous data makes it harder to detect positive samples since the most affected metrics by data distributions are Recall and F1.

AB The combination of drones and Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) have emerged as potential technologies for improving the performance of six Generation (6G) communication networks by proactively modifying wireless communication through smart signal reflection and manoeuvre control. By deploying the IRS on drones, it becomes possible to improve the coverage and reliability of the communication network while reducing energy consumption and costs. Furthermore, integrating IRS with Federated Learning (FL) can further boost the performance of the drone network by enabling collaborative learning among multiple drones, leading to better and more efficient decision-making and holding great promise for enabling 6G communication networks. Therefore, we present a novel framework for FL meets IRS in drones for enabling 6G. In this framework, multiple IRS-equipped drone swarm are deployed to form a distributed wireless network, where FL techniques are used to collaborate with the learning process and optimize the reflection coefficients of each drone-IRS. This allows drone swarm to adapt to changing communication environments and improve the coverage and quality of wireless communication services. Integrating FL and IRS into drones offers several advantages over traditional wireless communication networks, including rapid deployment in emergencies or disasters, improved coverage and quality of communication services, and increased accessibility to remote areas. Finally, we highlight the challenges and opportunities of integrating FL and IRS into drones for researchers interested in drone networks. We also help drive innovation in developing 6G communication networks.

AB As stated by Spock, "change is the essential process of all existence," which is reflected in everyday applications in our daily lives. We, as humans, just need to find a way to make the best use of the current technological advances. The pandemic has managed to exploit our deepest vulnerabilities and insecurities. We need to cope with a lot of things, just to be comfortable in the new normal. Hence, we can rely on technology, the greatest asset developed by humans. In this article, we discuss how we can enhance the work environment in offices post-pandemic. We combine federated learning with emotion analysis to create a state-of-the-art, simple, secure, and efficient emotion monitoring system. We combine facial expression and speech signals to find out macroexpressions and create an emotion index that is monitored to find the mental health of the user. Federated learning enables users to locally train the model without compromising his/her privacy. In place of sending data to the centralized server, the proposed scheme sends only model weights that are combined at the server to make a better global model, which is further pushed back to the users. This model is then trained interorganizational as it does not violate the privacy or data sharing to achieve optimal results. The data collected from users are monitored to analyze the mental health and presented with counseling solutions during low times. Technology is a panacea that has enabled us to survive in this pandemic, and by using our solution to improve work culture and the environment in post-pandemic times.

AB Enhanced by machine learning (ML) techniques, data-driven stability assessment (SA) in smart cyber-physical grids has attracted significant research interest in recent years. However, the current centralized ML architectures have limited scalability, are vulnerable to privacy exposure, and are costly to manage. To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel secure distributed SA method based on federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP), namely, Secure Federated SA (SecFedSA). It leverages local system operating data to predict and estimate the system stability status and optimize the power systems in a decentralized fashion. In order to preserve the privacy of the distributed SA operating data, SecFedSA incorporates Gaussian mechanism into DP. Theoretical analysis on the Gaussian mechanism of SecFedSA provides formal DP guarantees. Extensive experiments conducted on the New England 10-machine 39-bus testing system and the synthetic Illinois 49-machine 200-bus testing system demonstrate that the proposed SecFedSA method can achieve advantageous SA performance, while protecting the privacy of the local model information compared to the state of the art.

AB Data mining, integration, and utilization are the inevitable trend of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in the context of Big Data. With the increasing demand for data privacy, federated learning has emerged as a new paradigm, which enables distributed joint training of medical data sources without leaving the private domain. However, federated learning is suffering from security threats as the shared local model will reveal original datasets. Privacy leakage is even more fatal in healthcare because medical data contains critically sensitive information. In addition, open wireless channels are susceptible to malicious attacks. To further safeguard the privacy of IoMT, we propose a comprehensive privacy-preserving federated learning scheme with a tactful dropout handling mechanism. The proposed scheme leverages blind masking and certificateless proxy re-encryption (CL-PRE) for secure aggregation, ensuring the confidentiality of the local model and rendering the global model invisible to any parties other than clients. It also provides authentication of uploaded models while protecting identity privacy. Compared with other relevant schemes, our solution has better performance on functional features and efficiency, and is more applicable to IoMT systems with many devices.

ID CONVERGENCE
AB Federated learning (FL) has gained significant importance for intelligent applications, following data produced on a massive scale by numerous distributed IoT devices. From an FL perspective, the key aspect is that this data is not identically and independently distributed (IID) across different data sources and locations. This distribution-skewness leads to significant quality degradation. Moreover, an intrinsic consequence of using such non-IID data in decentralized learning is increasing costs that would be mitigated if using IID data. As a remedy, we propose a resource-efficient method for training an FL-based application with non-IID data, effectively minimizing cost through an auction approach and mitigating quality degradation through data sharing. In an experimental evaluation, we investigate the FL performance using real-world non-IID data and use the resulting ground-truth outputs to develop functions for estimating the utility of non-IID data, computational resource costs, and data generation costs. These functions are used to optimize the costs of model training, ensuring resource efficiency. It is further demonstrated that using shared-IID data significantly increases the resource efficiency of FL with local non-IID data. This holds true even when the shared IID data size is less than 1% of the size of the local non-IID data. Moreover, this work demonstrates that the profitability of the stakeholders can be maximized using the proposed auction procedure. The integration of the auction procedure and a resource-efficient training strategy allows FL service providers to create practical trading strategies by minimizing the FL clients' resources and payments in a machine learning marketplace.

AB BackgroundDeep learning (DL) has shown promising results in molecular-based classification of glioma subtypes from MR images. DL requires a large number of training data for achieving good generalization performance. Since brain tumor datasets are usually small in size, combination of such datasets from different hospitals are needed. Data privacy issue from hospitals often poses a constraint on such a practice. Federated learning (FL) has gained much attention lately as it trains a central DL model without requiring data sharing from different hospitals. MethodWe propose a novel 3D FL scheme for glioma and its molecular subtype classification. In the scheme, a slice-based DL classifier, EtFedDyn, is exploited which is an extension of FedDyn, with the key differences on using focal loss cost function to tackle severe class imbalances in the datasets, and on multi-stream network to exploit MRIs in different modalities. By combining EtFedDyn with domain mapping as the pre-processing and 3D scan-based post-processing, the proposed scheme makes 3D brain scan-based classification on datasets from different dataset owners. To examine whether the FL scheme could replace the central learning (CL) one, we then compare the classification performance between the proposed FL and the corresponding CL schemes. Furthermore, detailed empirical-based analysis were also conducted to exam the effect of using domain mapping, 3D scan-based post-processing, different cost functions and different FL schemes. ResultsExperiments were done on two case studies: classification of glioma subtypes (IDH mutation and wild-type on TCGA and US datasets in case A) and glioma grades (high/low grade glioma HGG and LGG on MICCAI dataset in case B). The proposed FL scheme has obtained good performance on the test sets (85.46%, 75.56%) for IDH subtypes and (89.28%, 90.72%) for glioma LGG/HGG all averaged on five runs. Comparing with the corresponding CL scheme, the drop in test accuracy from the proposed FL scheme is small (-1.17%, -0.83%), indicating its good potential to replace the CL scheme. Furthermore, the empirically tests have shown that an increased classification test accuracy by applying: domain mapping (0.4%, 1.85%) in case A; focal loss function (1.66%, 3.25%) in case A and (1.19%, 1.85%) in case B; 3D post-processing (2.11%, 2.23%) in case A and (1.81%, 2.39%) in case B and EtFedDyn over FedAvg classifier (1.05%, 1.55%) in case A and (1.23%, 1.81%) in case B with fast convergence, which all contributed to the improvement of overall performance in the proposed FL scheme. ConclusionThe proposed FL scheme is shown to be effective in predicting glioma and its subtypes by using MR images from test sets, with great potential of replacing the conventional CL approaches for training deep networks. This could help hospitals to maintain their data privacy, while using a federated trained classifier with nearly similar performance as that from a centrally trained one. Further detailed experiments have shown that different parts in the proposed 3D FL scheme, such as domain mapping (make datasets more uniform) and post-processing (scan-based classification), are essential.

AB At present, some studies have combined federated learning with blockchain, so that participants can conduct federated learning tasks under decentralized conditions, sharing and aggregating model parameters. However, these schemes do not take into account the trusted supervision of federated learning and the case of malicious node attacks. This paper introduces the concept of a trusted computing sandbox to solve this problem. A federated learning multi-task scheduling mechanism based on a trusted computing sandbox is designed and a decentralized trusted computing sandbox composed of computing resources provided by each participant is constructed as a state channel. The training process of the model is carried out in the channel and the malicious behavior is supervised by the smart contract, ensuring the data privacy of the participant node and the reliability of the calculation during the training process. In addition, considering the resource heterogeneity of participant nodes, the deep reinforcement learning method was used in this paper to solve the resource scheduling optimization problem in the process of constructing the state channel. The proposed algorithm aims to minimize the completion time of the system and improve the efficiency of the system while meeting the requirements of tasks on service quality as much as possible. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance than the traditional heuristic algorithm and meta-heuristic algorithm.

TI Implementing Vertical Federated Learning Using Autoencoders: Practical

AB Background: Machine learning (ML) is now widely deployed in our everyday lives. Building robust ML models requires a massive amount of data for training. Traditional ML algorithms require training data centralization, which raises privacy and data governance issues. Federated learning (FL) is an approach to overcome this issue. We focused on applying FL on vertically partitioned data, in which an individual's record is scattered among different sites.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to perform FL on vertically partitioned data to achieve performance comparable to that of centralized models without exposing the raw data.
   Methods: We used three different datasets (Adult income, Schwannoma, and eICU datasets) and vertically divided each dataset into different pieces. Following the vertical division of data, overcomplete autoencoder-based model training was performed for each site. Following training, each site's data were transformed into latent data, which were aggregated for training. A tabular neural network model with categorical embedding was used for training. A centrally based model was used as a baseline model, which was compared to that of FL in terms of accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).
   Results: The autoencoder-based network successfully transformed the original data into latent representations with no domain knowledge applied. These altered data were different from the original data in terms of the feature space and data distributions, indicating appropriate data security. The loss of performance was minimal when using an overcomplete autoencoder; accuracy loss was 1.2%, 8.89%, and 1.23%, and AUROC loss was 1.1%, 0%, and 1.12% in the Adult income, Schwannoma, and eICU dataset, respectively.
   Conclusions: We proposed an autoencoder-based ML model for vertically incomplete data. Since our model is based on unsupervised learning, no domain-specific knowledge is required in individual sites. Under the circumstances where direct data sharing is not available, our approach may be a practical solution enabling both data protection and building a robust model.

AB We propose cooperative edge-assisted dynamic federated learning ( CE-FL). CE-FL introduces a distributed machine learning (ML) architecture, where data collection is carried out at the end devices, while the model training is conducted cooperatively at the end devices and the edge servers, enabled via data offloading from the end devices to the edge servers through base stations. CE-FL also introduces floating aggregation point, where the local models generated at the devices and the servers are aggregated at an edge server, which varies from one model training round to another to cope with the network evolution in terms of data distribution and users' mobility. CE-FL considers the heterogeneity of network elements in terms of communication/computation models and the proximity to one another. CE-FL further presumes a dynamic environment with online variation of data at the network devices which causes a drift at the ML model performance. We model the processes taken during CE-FL, and conduct analytical convergence analysis of its ML model training. We then formulate network-aware CE-FL which aims to adaptively optimize all the network elements via tuning their contribution to the learning process, which turns out to be a non-convex mixed integer problem. Motivated by the large scale of the system, we propose a distributed optimization solver to break down the computation of the solution across the network elements. We finally demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with the data collected from a real-world testbed.

AB To address privacy concerns of state-of-the-art centralized machine learning in non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) applications, the adoption of federated learning (FL) has emerged as a solution to transfer training processes from cloud servers to edge devices. Nevertheless, conventional FL encounters several challenges including architecture safety, incentive mechanism, computing cost, and personalization. To overcome these challenges, the study proposes a self-motivated decentralized FL scheme for NILM, named blockchain-based clustered FL, by combining blockchain mechanism with clustered FL, incentivizing suitable clients to participate in FL by offering rewards based on data size and model performance. Under NILM-related differential privacy protections, the Laplace noise is injected into the first layer of neural networks in the blockchain-based clustered FL, and a decay factor is employed to mitigate the adverse effects of excessive noise on performance. Lightweight training techniques such as data quantization and weight pruning are employed to reduce computational complexity. Furthermore, a clustering approach is utilized to create multiple global models, thereby enhancing the model personalization degree. It is verified by the case study that the blockchain-based clustered FL outperforms the conventional FL in both accuracy and operation risk, and offers much superior performance and a more robust model compared to local training.

AB As communication technology evolves, specific emitter identification (SEI) gains significance in areas like wireless network security and IoT device identification. While big data and deep learning have spurred centralized identification methods, they often falter in low-resource, real-world settings due to data dispersion and heterogeneity, as well as limited computational power. Addressing these challenges, this paper presents feature-imitation federated learning (FIFL), a novel SEI approach for resource-constrained environments. FIFL utilizes a global classifier, refined through Kullback-Leibler divergence, to manage feature prediction alignment. Simulation results on actual data demonstrate FIFL's effectiveness in overcoming global model drift, ensuring accuracy and reliability even amidst diverse, distributed data in resource-limited settings.

AB The explosive growth of the interconnected vehicle network creates vast amounts of data within individual vehicles, offering exciting opportunities to develop advanced applications. FL (Federated Learning) is a game-changer for vehicular networks, enabling powerful distributed data processing across vehicles to build intelligent applications while promoting collaborative training and safeguarding data privacy. However, recent research has exposed a critical vulnerability in FL: poisoning attacks, where malicious actors can manipulate data, labels, or models to subvert the system. Despite its advantages, deploying FL in dynamic vehicular environments with a multitude of distributed vehicles presents unique challenges. One such challenge is the potential for a significant number of malicious actors to tamper with data. We propose a hierarchical FL framework for vehicular networks to address these challenges, promising lower latency and coverage. We also present a defense mechanism, LFGuard, which employs a detection system to pinpoint malicious vehicles. It then excludes their local models from the aggregation stage, significantly reducing their influence on the final outcome. We evaluate LFGuard against state-of-the-art techniques using the three popular benchmark datasets in a heterogeneous environment. Results illustrate LFGuard outperforms prior studies in thwarting targeted label-flipping attacks with more than 5% improvement in the global model accuracy, 12% in the source class recall, and a 6% reduction in the attack success rate while maintaining high model utility.

ID DESIGN
AB With the booming of mobile edge computing (MEC) and blockchain-based blockchain-based federated learning (BCFL), more studies suggest deploying BCFL on edge servers. In this case, edge servers with restricted resources face the dilemma of serving both mobile devices for their offloading tasks and the BCFL system for model training and blockchain consensus without sacrificing the service quality to any side. To address this challenge, this article proposes a resource allocation scheme for edge servers to provide optimal services at the minimum cost. Specifically, we first analyze the energy consumption of the MEC and BCFL tasks, considering the completion time of each task as the service quality constraint. Then, we model the resource allocation challenge into a multivariate, multiconstraint, and convex optimization problem. While solving the problem in a progressive manner, we design two algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) in both homogeneous and heterogeneous situations, where equal and on-demand resource distribution strategies are, respectively, adopted. The validity of our proposed algorithms is proved via rigorous theoretical analysis. Moreover, the convergence and efficiency of our proposed resource allocation schemes are evaluated through extensive experiments.

TI CC-FedAvg: Computationally Customized Federated Averaging

DE Computation efficiency; computation heterogeneity; federated learning
   (FL); model estimation; unbiased aggregation
AB Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm to train model with distributed data from numerous Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It inherently assumes a uniform capacity among participants. However, due to different conditions such as differing energy budgets or executing parallel unrelated tasks, participants have diverse computational resources in practice. Participants with insufficient computation budgets must plan for the use of restricted computational resources appropriately; otherwise, they would be unable to complete the entire training procedure, resulting in model performance decline. To address this issue, we propose a strategy for estimating local models without computationally intensive iterations. Based on it, we propose computationally customized federated averaging (CC-FedAvg), which allows participants to determine whether to perform traditional local training or model estimation in each round based on their current computational budgets. Both theoretical analysis and exhaustive experiments indicate that CC-FedAvg has the same convergence rate and comparable performance as FedAvg without resource constraints. Furthermore, CC-FedAvg can be viewed as a computation-efficient version of FedAvg that retains model performance while considerably lowering computation overhead.

AB With the advancements in decision-making & learning models, it is worth investigating the synchronization between the conventional decision-making approaches and the federated learning process so as to obtain an intelligent hybrid assessment approach. The present paper incorporates the notion of $q$ -rung picture fuzzy set and bi-parametric discriminant information measure in the federated learning-oriented TOPSIS/VIKOR decision-making models for electronic marketing strategic plans. With the help of embedding federated learning, the multi-criteria decision-making process acquires the additional advantage of establishing the pairwise comparison from the decision-makers. A trusted model in the assessment of the potential strategic plans for electronic goods marketing in view of the criteria and the available alternatives has been structured and computationally evaluated.

TI FedRecovery: Differentially Private Machine Unlearning for Federated

DE Index Terms- Machine unlearning; differential privacy; feder-ated
   learning
AB Over the past decades, the abundance of personal data has led to the rapid development of machine learning models and important advances in artificial intelligence (AI). However, alongside all the achievements, there are increasing privacy threats and security risks that may cause significant losses for data providers. Recent legislation requires that the private information about a user should be removed from a database as well as machine learning models upon certain deletion requests. While erasing data records from memory storage is straightforward, it is often challenging to remove the influence of particular data samples from a model that has already been trained. Machine unlearning is an emerging paradigm that aims to make machine learning models "forget" what they have learned about particular data. Nevertheless, the unlearning issue for federated learning has not been completely addressed due to its special working mode. First, existing solutions crucially rely on retraining-based model calibration, which is likely unavailable and can pose new privacy risks for federated learning frameworks. Second, today's efficient unlearning strategies are mainly designed for convex problems, which are incapable of handling more complicated learning tasks like neural networks. To overcome these limitations, we took advantage of differential privacy and developed an efficient machine unlearning algorithm named FedRecovery. The FedRecovery erases the impact of a client by removing a weighted sum of gradient residuals from the global model, and tailors the Gaussian noise to make the unlearned model and retrained model statistically indistinguishable. Furthermore, the algorithm neither requires retraining-based fine-tuning nor needs the assumption of convexity. Theoretical analyses show the rigorous indistinguishability guarantee. Additionally, the experiment results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the FedRecovery is efficient and is able to produce a model that performs similarly to the retrained one.

AB Insider threats in Internet of Things (IoT) networks pose significant risks, as compromised devices can misuse their privileges to cause substantial harm. Centralized methods for insider threat detection in IoT devices are critical for identifying and mitigating insider risks. User behavior, such as access patterns, login times and data transmission, is profiled using machine learning algorithms to detect deviations that may indicate insider risks. However, training a model that generalizes across different data sources is challenging due to data heterogeneity, which can lead to a drift in performance. This paper introduces a decentralized approach called federated learning (FL) to address these challenges. An advanced privacy-preserving method is proposed for detecting and reducing insider threats in IoT devices. The process begins with a trust authority generating a random digital certificate using the hybrid Rivest-Shamir-Adleman and elliptic curve digital signature algorithm for IoT user registration. Node clustering is performed using the ordering points to identify the clustering structure with centroid refinement algorithm, ensuring data privacy by transmitting only cluster heads to local models. Additionally, the federated automatic weight optimization hash-based message authentication code with secure hash algorithm is introduced to further strengthen protection. The experimental results show accuracy rates of 98.85% on the simulated dataset and 83.74% on the X-IIoTID test dataset. These finding facilitates the effectiveness of the proposed solution in terms of accuracy, time, throughput, node scalability and overall performance. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms other prominent approaches in the field.

ID DISTRIBUTED ESTIMATION
AB Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a fundamental technique widely used in various applications, such as recommendation systems and principal component analyses. In recent years, the need for privacy-preserving computations has been increasing constantly, which concerns SVD as well. Federated SVD has emerged as a promising approach that enables collaborative SVD computation without sharing raw data. However, existing federated approaches still need improvements regarding privacy guarantees and utility preservation. This paper moves a step further towards these directions: we propose two enhanced federated SVD schemes focusing on utility and privacy, respectively. Using a recommendation system use-case with real-world data, we demonstrate that our schemes outperform the state-of-the-art federated SVD solution. Our utility-enhanced scheme (utilizing secure aggregation) improves the final utility and the convergence speed by more than 2.5 times compared with the existing state-of-the-art approach. In contrast, our privacy-enhancing scheme (utilizing differential privacy) provides more robust privacy protection while improving the same aspect by more than 25%.

AB Breast cancer is a critical health issue affecting the well-being of women. Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of the increase in the mortality rate of women around the world. Early detection of breast cancer can, to some extent, decrease the number of deaths caused and also improve treatment outcomes and patient survival rates. Traditional Machine learning (ML) and Deep learning (DL) approaches have proven to be more successful in predicting breast cancer. In terms of privacy and early detection, Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized ML approach, offers a promising solution for training predictive models on distributed healthcare data while ensuring privacy and security. This paper proposes a novel framework that combines the benefits of integrating Shapley values and game theory concepts with FL for breast cancer prediction. The framework uses Shapley values for feature selection from 30 features of the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset from University of California Irvine machine learning repository (UCI ML). The framework also addresses the issue of poor-performing clients by introducing a payoff mechanism based on individual client accuracy. Clients with higher accuracy are given greater influence in the model aggregation process, encouraging client competition and improving the overall model performance. Our framework proves to be promising by achieving a prediction accuracy of 94.73% in the FL environment. The proposed approach provides a privacy-preserving solution for breast cancer prediction in an FL environment, by combining Shapley values and game theory. The results of this study can help in the development of more accurate and robust breast cancer prediction models, contributing to improved patient outcomes and healthcare decision-making.

AB In this work, a <italic>Hybrid Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning</italic> (HHFEL) architecture that consists of a device layer, an edge layer, and a cloud layer over heterogeneous networks, is investigated for large-scale model training. In such systems, learning efficiency is severely degraded by limited communication resources and device heterogeneity in terms of local data distribution and computation capability, especially for synchronous FL mechanisms where the training of each round should wait for the slowest device. To tackle this issue, asynchronous FL is proposed, which allows the devices with powerful computation and communication capabilities exchanging information with the server more frequently. However, this asynchronous FL framework faces a new challenge of low accuracy caused by the imbalanced local model updating. To overcome the shortage of both synchronous and asynchronous FLs, we propose an enhanced online semi-asynchronous FL mechanism between the edge-device layers, where each device trains its local model with the newly generated data and each edge server aggregates a number of local models based on their arrival order in each round. Particularly, devices with faster training speeds would fully utilize the idle time by training their local models repetitively. Meanwhile, synchronous FL with an edge elastic update strategy is adopted to the cloud-edge layers for personalized information exchange. Considering the continuous data generation feature, we formulate the objective problem as an online <italic>Markov Decision Process</italic> (MDP) to realize efficient communication-and-computing HHFEL via joint device selection and resource allocation. Due to the non-convex and combinatorial problem structure, we develop a hybrid <italic>Deep Q-Network</italic> (DQN) and <italic>Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient</italic> (DDPG) approach with low computational complexity to adapt the device selection and resource allocation strategies. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism compared with existing benchmarks.

AB While preserving the privacy of federated learning (FL), differential privacy (DP) inevitably degrades the utility (i.e., accuracy) of FL due to model perturbations caused by DP noise added to model updates. Existing studies have considered exclusively noise with persistent root-mean-square amplitude and overlooked an opportunity of adjusting the amplitudes to alleviate the adverse effects of the noise. This paper presents a new DP perturbation mechanism with a time-varying noise amplitude to protect the privacy of FL and retain the capability of adjusting the learning performance. Specifically, we propose a geometric series form for the noise amplitude and reveal analytically the dependence of the series on the number of global aggregations and the (e, d)-DP requirement. We derive an online refinement of the series to prevent FL from premature convergence resulting from excessive perturbation noise. Another important aspect is an upper bound developed for the loss function of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained by FL running the new DP mechanism. Accordingly, the optimal number of global aggregations is obtained, balancing the learning and privacy. Extensive experiments are conducted using MLP, supporting vector machine, and convolutional neural network models on four public datasets. The contribution of the new DP mechanism to the convergence and accuracy of privacy-preserving FL is corroborated, compared to the state-of-the-art Gaussian noise mechanism with a persistent noise amplitude.

TI Split Aggregation: Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning

AB Federated Learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm optimizing communication costs and enhancing privacy by uploading gradients instead of raw data, now confronts security challenges. It is particularly vulnerable to Byzantine poisoning attacks and potential privacy breaches via inference attacks. While homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation have been employed to design robust FL mechanisms, these predominantly rely on Euclidean distance or median-based metrics and often fall short in comprehensively defending against advanced poisoning attacks, such as adaptive attacks. Addressing this issue, our study introduces "Split-Aggregation", a lightweight privacy-preserving FL solution capable of withstanding adaptive attacks. This method maintains a computational complexity of O(d k N+k(3)) and a communication overhead of O(dN) , performing comparably to FedAvg when k=10 . Here, d represents the gradient dimension, N the number of users, and k the rank chosen during random singular value decomposition. Additionally, we utilize adaptive weight coefficients to mitigate gradient descent issues in honest users caused by non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. The proposed method's security and robustness are theoretically proven, with its complexity thoroughly analyzed. Experimental results demonstrate that at $k=10$ , this method surpasses the top-1 accuracy of current state-of-the-art robust privacy-preserving FL approaches. Moreover, opting for a smaller k significantly boosts efficiency with only marginal compromises in accuracy.

ID CONVERGENCE
AB The advances of both computation and communication technologies facilitate the exploitation of massive data generated by mobile devices. It is attractive to leverage these data and computation resources to train high-performance machine learning (ML) models. In traditional ML methods, all data are uploaded to servers for model training, which incur issues of large overhead and privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) was proposed to address these issues. In this paper, we propose FedPCC, an efficient approach based on the parallelism of communication and computation among devices for FL in wireless networks. FedPCC considers the difference in communication and computation capabilities between different devices and optimizes the training schedule for devices selected in each round. Instead of dividing an FL training round into separate communication and computation steps, FedPCC protocol arranges devices to download the global model sequentially and then start local model training immediately once finishing downloading, which allows better utilization of communication and computation resources. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the time for each training round and propose an algorithm to solve the problem based on the trade-off of devices' communication and computation capabilities. FedPCC uses a heuristic algorithm to make slow devices start relatively earlier, which can shorten the time in one training round, thus reducing the entire training time. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed protocol outperforms the existing protocols under different system settings.

AB Since the scaling of advanced technology nodes is pushing to its physical limit, lithography hotspot detection (LHD) has become more significant than ever in design for manufacturability. Recently, machine learning techniques have been deployed to greatly reduce simulation time for hotspot detection, but high-quality data are required to build a model. Many design companies do not have enough high-quality data and are hesitant to share it for fear of intellectual property theft or model ineffectiveness. Furthermore, using locally trained models with limited and similar data can lead to overfitting and a lack of generalization and robustness when applied to new designs. In this article, we propose a heterogeneous federated learning framework for LHD that can address the aforementioned issues. Our framework can overcome the challenges of nonindependent and identically distributed data and heterogeneous communication, ensuring high performance and good convergence in various scenarios. The proposed framework creates a more robust centralized global submodel through heterogeneous knowledge sharing while keeping local data private. Then, it combines the global submodel with a local submodel for better adaptation to local data heterogeneity. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

DT Article
DE Decentralized federated learning; Domain generalization; Fault diagnosis
AB Fault diagnosis is important for maintaining safety in industrial scenarios. Due to the complex operating conditions, there is usually a domain shift between training (source) data and testing (target) data. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of numerous transfer learning methods dealing with the domain shift. However, existing methods often fail to deal with the situation where target data are unavailable. Moreover, the majority of these methods require aggregating data distributed across various users (nodes) for model training, raising privacy concerns. Despite existing federated learning methods can protect privacy, they mostly rely on a central server, which may lead to a single point of failure. To address the above issues, we propose a fully decentralized Federated Domain Generalization with Cluster Alignment (FDG-CA), which deals with the domain shift problem without accessing target data and eliminates the need of a central server while protecting privacy. During the training phase, the proposed FDG-CA learns domain-invariant representations by aligning clusters statistics of different source nodes through information exchange. Subsequently, during the testing phase, we propose an ensemble strategy based on a learner filter and a voting scheme to get the prediction results. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is superior to existing methods, achieving higher accuracy while addressing privacy concerns.

TI An Incentive Auction for Heterogeneous Client Selection in Federated

DE Federated learning; incentive mechanism; auction
ID MECHANISM
AB Learning (FL) is a new distributed machine learning (ML) approach which enables thousands of mobile devices to collaboratively train artificial intelligence (AI) models using local data without compromising user privacy. Although FL represents a promising computing paradigm, such training process can not be fully realized without an appropriate economic mechanism that incentivizes the participation of heterogeneous clients. This work targets social cost minimization, and studies the incentive mechanism design in FL through a procurement auction. Different from existing literature, we consider a practical scenario of FL where clients are selected and scheduled at different global iterations to guarantee the completion of the FL job, and capture the distinct feature of FL that the number of global iterations is determined by the local accuracy of all participants to balance between computation and communication. Our auction framework A(FL) first decomposes the social cost minimization problem into a series of winner determination problems (WDPs) based on the number of global iterations. To solve each WDP, A(FL) invokes a greedy algorithm to determine the winners, and a payment algorithm for computing remuneration to winners. Finally, A(FL) returns the best solution among all WDPs. We carried out theoretical analysis to prove that AFL is truthful, individual rational, computationally efficient, and achieves a near-optimal social cost. We further extend our model to consider multiple FL jobs with corresponding budgets and propose another efficient algorithm A(FL-M) to solve the extended problem. We conduct large-scale simulations based on the real-world data and testbed experiments by adopting FL frameworks FAVOR and CoCoA. Simulation and experiment results show that both A(FL) and A(FL-M) can reduce the social cost by up to 55% compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

ID RESOURCE-ALLOCATION
AB To alleviate the substantial local training burden on clients in the federated learning (FL) process, this paper proposes a more efficient approach based on hybrid federated and centralized learning (HFCL), leveraging the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) environment within wireless communication networks. Considering the existence of heterogeneous data types with different privacy levels -such as 1) sensitive data, which can not be exposed, and 2) less-sensitive data, which can be exposed for centralized learning (CL)-we formulate an optimization problem aimed at achieving a balance between 1) total latency, including computation and communication, and 2) the training burden on the MEC server. This balance is achieved by adjusting the set of participants in FL, taking into account client selection under different privacy levels. A multi-objective optimization problem is designed using mixed-integer nonlinear programming, which is generally recognized as NP-hard. We employ relaxation techniques in combination with the Mutas & Simulated Annealing Heuristic algorithm to develop a near-optimal yet practical algorithm. Our numerical and simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme effectively achieves a global model by striking a balance between the total time required for model convergence and the computational load on the MEC server. Furthermore, experimental results on three well-known real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme maintains an acceptable level of accuracy and loss.

AB Traffic state estimation (TSE) is attracting significant attention due to its importance to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) for various applications, such as vehicle path planning. In classic IoV, the real-time traffic data collected by road side units requires transferring to the cloud server for processing. Such a centralized manner may raise privacy leakage issues. Split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as one of the prevalent methods to solve these issues. However, recent studies have shown that the existing SFL frameworks are vulnerable to the model inversion (MI) attacks, leading to private raw data leakage. To this end, in this article, we propose ShieldTSE, a privacy-enhanced SFL framework for TSE in IoV. To protect privacy and maintain utility, a variational encoder-decoder-based privacy-preserving feature extraction module with adversarial learning is first proposed to generate better privacy-preserved intermediate activations with a lower-dimensional feature space. Then, a hard attention-based feature selection module is designed to select partial yet crucial features from the intermediate activations by removing redundant sensitive features to further reduce the data privacy leakage. Experimental results demonstrate that ShieldTSE achieves superior privacy-preserving ability when against training-based and optimization-based MI attacks with an average reconstruction mean-square error (MSE) improvement of 18x and 35x on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY compared to the baseline without the privacy-preserving strategy, respectively. ShieldTSE also successfully maintains better model utility compared to the privacy protection baselines.

AB Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have facilitated continuous improvement in smart city based applications such as smart healthcare, transportation, and environmental management. Digital Twin (DT) is an AI-based virtual replica of the real-world physical entity. DTs have been successfully adopted in manufacturing and industrial sectors, they are however still at the early stage in smart city based applications. The major reason for this lag is the lack of trust and privacy issues in sharing sensitive data. Federated Learning (FL) is a technology that could be integrated along with DT to ensure privacy preservation and trustworthiness. This paper focuses on the integration of these two promising technologies for adoption in real-time and life-critical scenarios, as well as for ease of governance in smart city based applications. We present an extensive survey on the various smart city based applications of FL models in DTs. Based on the study, some prominent challenges and future directions are presented for better FL-DT integration in future applications.

AB Multi-Party Computation (MPC) provides an effective cryptographic solution for distributed computing systems so that local models with sensitive information are encrypted before sending to the centralized servers for aggregation. Though direct local knowledge leakages are eliminated in MPC-based algorithms, we observe the server can still obtain the local information indirectly in many scenarios, or even reveal the groundtruth images through methods like Deep Leakage from Gradients (DLG). To eliminate such possibilities and provide stronger protections, we propose an augmented MPC approach by encrypting local models with two rounds of decomposition before transmitting to the server. The proposed solution allows us to remove the constraint that servers must be honest in the general federated learning settings since the true global model is hidden from the servers. Specifically, the augmented MPC algorithm encodes local models into multiple secret shares in the first round, then each share is furthermore split into a public share and a private share. Consequences of such a two-round decomposition are that the augmented algorithm fully inherits the advantages of standard MPC by providing lossless encryption and decryption while simultaneously rendering the global model invisible to the central server. Both theoretical analysis and experimental verification demonstrate that such an augmented solution can provide stronger protections for the security and privacy of the training data, with minimal extra communication and computation costs incurred.

AB With the rapid development of the 5G network and the promising of 6G network, vehicles can report a large amount of real-time traffic information to Road-Side Units (RSUs). However, due to the large communication cost, limited computing resources, and privacy leakage risks, centralized data processing by RSUs is not efficient and not secure. Thereby, federated learning is introduced to enable vehicles to train local models and send the model parameters to the RSUs, without the need for revealing their personal data. Nevertheless, without an efficient incentive mechanism, the vehicles, as data owners, may be unwilling to join the federated learning task. In this paper, we adopt contract theory to design an incentive mechanism with asymmetric information and continuum of types for interaction between the RSU and vehicles. The designed mechanism satisfies the incentive compatibility, individual rationality and also maximizes the RSU's profit. The technical challenge is to solve a non-quadratic functional optimization in continuous space with coupling constraints among the vehicles. To address this challenge, we propose two iterative algorithms to find the RSU's optimal strategies as the functions of vehicles' types. In the first algorithm, a combination of the calculus of variation and dual decomposition methods is utilized to achieve an analytical solution for the optimal strategy of RSU, while in the second one, a combination of approximate dynamic programming and neural networks is used to estimate the optimal strategy of RSU.

AB Machine learning (ML) is a widely accepted means for supporting customized services for mobile devices and applications. Federated Learning (FL), which is a promising approach to implement machine learning while addressing data privacy concerns, typically involves a large number of wireless mobile devices to collect model training data. Under such circumstances, FL is expected to meet stringent training latency requirements in the face of limited resources such as demand for wireless bandwidth, power consumption, and computation constraints of participating devices. Due to practical considerations, FL selects a portion of devices to participate in the model training process at each iteration. Therefore, the tasks of efficient resource management and device selection will have a significant impact on the practical uses of FL. In this paper, we propose a spectrum allocation optimization mechanism for enhancing FL over a wireless mobile network. Specifically, the proposed spectrum allocation optimization mechanism minimizes the time delay of FL while considering the energy consumption of individual participating devices; thus ensuring that all the participating devices have sufficient resources to train their local models. In this connection, to ensure fast convergence of FL, a robust device selection is also proposed to help FL reach convergence swiftly, especially when the local datasets of the devices are not independent and identically distributed (non-iid). Experimental results show that (1) the proposed spectrum allocation optimization method optimizes time delay while satisfying the individual energy constraints; (2) the proposed device selection method enables FL to achieve the fastest convergence on non-iid datasets.

TI In-Network Computation for Large-Scale Federated Learning Over Wireless

AB Most conventional Federated Learning (FL) models are using a star network topology where all users aggregate their local models at a single server (e.g., a cloud server). That causes significant overhead in terms of both communications and computing at the server, delaying the training process, especially for large scale FL systems with straggling nodes. This article proposes a novel edge network architecture that enables decentralizing the model aggregation process at the server, thereby significantly reducing the training delay for the whole FL network. Specifically, we design a highly-effective in-network computation framework (INC) consisting of a user scheduling mechanism, an in-network aggregation process (INA) which is designed for both primal- and primal-dual methods in distributed machine learning problems, and a network routing algorithm with theoretical performance bounds. The in-network aggregation process, which is implemented at edge nodes and cloud node, can adapt two typical methods to allow edge networks to effectively solve the distributed machine learning problems. Under the proposed INA, we then formulate a joint routing and resource optimization problem, aiming to minimize the aggregation latency. The problem turns out to be NP-hard, and thus we propose a polynomial time routing algorithm which can achieve near optimal performance with a theoretical bound. Simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm can achieve more than 99% of the optimal solution and reduce the FL training latency, up to 5.6 times w.r.t other baselines. The proposed INC framework can not only help reduce the FL training latency but also significantly decrease cloud's traffic and computing overhead. By embedding the computing/aggregation tasks at the edge nodes and leveraging the multi-layer edge-network architecture, the INC framework can liberate FL from the star topology to enable large-scale FL.

AB The social Internet of Medical Things (S-IoMT) highly demands dependable and non-invasive device identification and authentication and makes data services more prevalent in a reliable learning system. In real time, healthcare systems consistently acquire, analyze, and transform a few operational intelligence into actionable forms through digitization to capture the sensitive information of the patient. Since the S-IoMT tries to distribute health-related services using IoT devices and wireless technologies, protecting the privacy of data and security of the device is so crucial in any eHealth system. To fulfill the design objectives of eHealth, smart sensing technologies use built-in features of social networking services. Despite being more convenient in its potential use, a significant concern is a security preventing potential threats and infringement. Thus, this paper presents a lightweight two-factor authentication framework (L2FAK) with privacy-preserving functionality, which uses a mobile sink for smart eHealth. Formal and informal analyses prove that the proposed L2FAK can resist cyberattacks such as session stealing, message modification, and denial of service, guaranteeing device protection and data integrity. The learning analysis verifies the features of the physical layer using federated learning layered authentication (FLLA) to learn the data characteristics by exploring the learning framework of neural networks. In the evaluation, the core scenario is implemented on the TensorFlow Federated framework to examine FLLA and other relevant mechanisms on two correlated datasets, namely, MNIST and FashionMNIST. The analytical results show that the proposed FLLA can analyze the protection of privacy features effectively in order to guarantee an accuracy asymptotic to 89.83% to 93.41% better than other mechanisms. Lastly, a real-time testbed demonstrates the significance of the proposed L2FAK in achieving better quality metrics, such as transmission efficiency and overhead ratio than other state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used as drones' edge Intelligence to assist with data collection, training models, and communication over wireless networks. UAV use for smart cities is rapidly growing in various industries, including tracking and surveillance, military defense, managing healthcare delivery, wireless communications, and more. In traditional machine learning techniques, an enormous amount of sensor data from UAVs must be shared to central storage to perform model training, which poses serious privacy risks and risks of misuse of information. The federated learning technique (FL), which can be applied to UAVs, is a promising means of collaboratively training a global model while retaining local access to sensitive raw data. Despite this, FL is a significant communication burden for battery-constrained UAVs due to local model training and global synchronization frequency. In this article, we address the major challenges associated with UAV-based FL for smart cities, including single-point failure, privacy leakage, scalability, and global model verification. To tackle these challenges, we present a differentially private federated learning framework based on Accumulative Reputation-based Selection (ARS) for the edge-aided UAV network that utilizes blockchains to prevent single-point failures where we switched from central control to decentralized control, Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for off-chain model storage and their respective hash-keys on-chain to ensure model integrity. Due to IPFS, the size of the blockchain will be reduced, and local differential privacy will be applied to prevent privacy leakages. In the proposed framework, an aggregator will be selected based on its ARS score and model verification by the validators. After most validators approve it, it will be available for use. Several parameters are taken into consideration during evaluation, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and time consumption. It also evaluates the number of edge computers vs test accuracy, the number of edge computers vs time consumption for global model convergence, and the number of rounds vs test accuracy. This is done by considering two benchmark datasets: MNIST and CIFAR-10. The results show that the proposed work preserves privacy while achieving high accuracy. Moreover, it is scalable to accommodate many participants.

AB This paper proposes a novel traffic monitoring framework, namely, DeepMonitor, for SDN-based IoT networks to provide fine-grained traffic analysis capability for different IoT traffic types at the network edges. Specifically, we first develop an intelligent flow rule match-field control system, called DeepMonitor agent, for SDN-based IoT edge nodes, taking different granularity-level requirements and their maximum flow-table capacity into consideration. We then formulate the control optimization problem for each edge node employing the Markov decision process (MDP). Next, we develop a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm to quickly achieve the optimal flow rule match-field policy. Moreover, we propose a federated DDQN-based traffic monitoring mechanism to significantly improve the learning performance of the edge nodes. The results obtained through extensive emulations show that by applying the DeepMonitor, the flow-table overflow problem at the edge nodes can be completely bypassed. The average number of match-fields in a flow rule achieved by DeepMonitor is increased by approximately 37% (for medium and diverse granularity-level requirements) and 41.9% (for high granularity-level requirement) compared to that of an existing solution, i.e., FlowStat. Finally, by adopting DeepMonitor, the DDoS attack detection performance of an intrusion detection system can be enhanced by up to 22.83% compared with that of FlowStat.

AB In the field of Web services computing, a recent demand trend is to mine user preferences based on user requirements when creating Web service compositions, in order to meet comprehensive and ever evolving user needs. Machine learning methods such as the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) have been applied for user preference mining. However, training a high-quality LDA model typically requires large amounts of data. With the prevalence of government regulations and laws and the enhancement of people's awareness of privacy protection, the traditional way of collecting user data on a central server is no longer applicable. Therefore, it is necessary to design a privacy -preserving method to train an LDA model without massive collecting or leaking data. In this paper, we present novel federated LDA techniques to learn user preferences in the Web service ecosystem. On the basis of a user-level distributed LDA algorithm, we establish two federated LDA models in charge of two-layer training scenarios: a centralized synchronous federated LDA (CSFed-LDA) for synchronous scenarios and a decentralized asynchronous federated LDA (DAFed-LDA) for asynchronous ones. In the former CSFed-LDA model, an importance-based partially homomorphic encryption (IPHE) technique is developed to protect privacy in an efficient manner. In the latter DAFed-LDA model, blockchain technology is incor- porated and a multi-channel-based authority control scheme (MCACS) is designed to enhance data security. Extensive experiments over a real-world dataset ProgrammableWeb.com have demonstrated the model performance, security assurance and training speed of our approach.

ID MECHANISM; SCHEME
AB We propose a decentralized medical trust management system using blockchain-based federated learning for large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems. The proposed system enables health institutions to share data without revealing the privacy of data owners. Health institutions form coalitions and the leader of each coalition is elected based on the proposed proof-of-trust collaboration (PoTC) consensus protocol. The PoTC consensus protocol is based on a weight difference game where trust scores, trust consistency value, and trust deviation are factors used for evaluating nodes in the blockchain. The trust of a node is obtained either through direct trust or recommended trust evaluations. Each leader elects an aggregator who has the most credibility to manage the proposed federated learning system. The leaders become the federated clients as well as validators while the aggregator is the federated server. To ensure the decentralization of nodes, a consortium blockchain is employed. Extensive simulations are performed, which show that the proposed system not only demonstrates scalability and credibility without compromising the accuracy, convergence, and resilience properties against malicious attackers but also outperforms existing trust management systems. A security analysis is also conducted, which shows that the proposed system is robust against trust-related attacks.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB In a smart city, IoT devices are required to support monitoring of normal operations such as traffic, infrastructure, and the crowd of people. IoT-enabled systems offered by many IoT devices are expected to achieve sustainable developments from the information collected by the smart city. Indeed, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are well-known methods for achieving this goal as long as the system framework and problem statement are well prepared. However, to better use AI/ML, the training data should be as global as possible, which can prevent the model from working only on local data. Such data can be obtained from different sources, but this induces the privacy issue where at least one party collects all data in the plain. The main focus of this article is on support vector machines (SVM). We aim to present a solution to the privacy issue and provide confidentiality to protect the data. We build a privacy-preserving scheme for SVM (SecretSVM) based on the framework of federated learning and distributed consensus. In this scheme, data providers self-organize and obtain training parameters of SVM without revealing their own models.

AB Federated learning (FL) when deployed in an Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem can facilitate the collaborative training of a global model involving different IoT local systems. However, there are a number of challenges in such deployments, and examples include single point of failure / attack, lack of fault tolerance, vulnerability to collusion attacks and accuracy loss. Therefore, we propose a privacy-preserving serverless FL scheme for IoT based on secure multiparty computation. Specifically, in our scheme, no central sever is required to coordinate the generation of global models. In doing so, we avoid the single point of failure / attack limitation. We also mitigate the fault tolerance limitation by using secret sharing. Finally, we provide a formal security proof that demonstrates the resilience of our scheme against collusion attacks, thereby establishing its effectiveness in achieving robust data privacy. Simulations are also implemented to show that our scheme does not suffer from accuracy loss.

AB Facial expression cognition technology continues to face challenges from certain perspectives despite the fact that there have been significant recent learning advances in computer vision in the areas involving posture, orientation, and viewing mode of photos or videos that affects the device performance. In particular, the current distributed machine learning schemes do not consider the privacy issue in face monitoring data. Hence, this paper proposes a new federated learning framework for unsupervised multidomain face recognition of postexercise. It is a graph AE design base to ensure multiple edge devices can cooperate with each other to ensure the optimization of the common objective function of the model to enhance the efficiency and speed of the global model. In addition, a multidomain learning loss function is proposed to share the common feature representation with other related tasks to improve domain adaptability. Adversarial learning is used to improve the recognition effect of the federated framework in each domain. The proposed scheme is validated on different multidomains expression datasets and the experimental results indicate a 19% higher F1 score than the benchmark scheme in multidomain face recognition tasks.

AB Wireless video offloading in mobile-edge-computing (MEC)-enabled Industrial Internet of Things imposes a risk of exposing users' private data to eavesdroppers. It is difficult for existing secure video offloading schemes to simultaneously guarantee security, reduce latency and energy consumption in privacy-sensitive multi-cell scenarios where users are unwilling to offload data to other cells. In this paper, a secure video offloading scheme based on multi-cell federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed to facilitate a secure, real-time and efficient MEC network by efficient orchestration of limited resources. We formulate a collaborative optimization problem of video frame resolution and resources to minimize latency and energy consumption while maximizing the security rate subject to analytic accuracy and limited resources. To solve the formulated NP-hard problem, a multi-cell federated DRL algorithm based on the frameworks of multi-cell horizontal federated learning (FL) and hierarchical reward function-based twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) is proposed. First of all, hierarchical reward function-based TD3 is employed to solve the collaborative optimization NP-hard problem formulated for each single cell, where the optimal solution can be efficiently approached by the agent under the guidance of the innovatively designed hierarchical reward function. Then, multi-cell horizontal FL is applied on TD3 to obtain a model with higher model quality by averagely aggregating multiple individual TD3 models. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms comparison algorithms in terms of utility, cost, latency, energy consumption and security rate.

AB In smart grids, a major challenge is how to effectively utilize consumers' energy consumption data while preserving security and privacy. In this article, we tackle this challenging issue and focus on energy theft detection, which is very important for smart grids. Specifically, we note that most existing energy theft detection schemes are centralized, which may be unscalable, and more importantly, may be very difficult to protect data privacy. To address this issue, we propose a novel privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection, namely, FedDetect. In our framework, we consider a federated learning system that consists of a data center (DC), a control center (CC), and multiple detection stations. In this system, each detection station (DTS) can only observe data from local consumers, which can use a local differential privacy (LDP) scheme to process their data to preserve privacy. To facilitate the training of the model, we design a secure protocol so that detection stations can send encrypted training parameters to the CC and the DC, which then use homomorphic encryption to calculate the aggregated parameters and return updated model parameters to detection stations. In our study, we prove the security of the proposed protocol with solid security analysis. To detect energy theft, we design a deep learning model based on the state-of-the-art temporal convolutional network (TCN). Finally, we conduct extensive data-driven experiments using a real-energy consumption data set. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed federated learning framework can achieve high accuracy of detection with a smaller computation overhead.

AB Federated edge learning (FEEL) is a promising collaborative paradigm, which employs edge devices (EDs) to train machine learning models for a federation. It opens countless opportunities to enable edge intelligence. The increasingly diversified demands for intelligent services are driving the deployment of various federations at the edge. Existing works on FEEL focus on a single federation and ignore inter-federation device competition and intra-device resource allocation, which hinders the applications of FEEL. To address this issue, this article first investigates the bottlenecks of executing multiple federations and builds a joint optimization model as a two-stage Stackelberg game involving device selection and resource allocation. To tackle the problem efficiently, we present a game-theoretical approach named Device Selection and Resource Allocation for Multiple Federations Game (DSRAMF-G). First, following the arbitrary device selection of leaders (i.e., federations), the time cost minimization of followers (i.e., EDs) is modeled as a convex problem to obtain the optimal resource allocation. Then, based on followers' optimal responses, device selection is modeled as a congestion game. We prove the existence of the Nash equilibrium and propose a decentralized mechanism. Finally, extensive experiments show that DSRAMF-G significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 5.9x training speedup and 2.8x resource-savings.

AB Malicious social bots pose a serious threat to social network security by spreading false information and guiding bad opinions in social networks. The singularity and scarcity of single organization data and the high cost of labeling social bots have given rise to the construction of federated models that combine federated learning with social bot detection. In this paper, we first combine the federated learning framework with the Relational Graph Convolutional Neural Network (RGCN) model to achieve federated social bot detection. A class-level cross entropy loss function is applied in the local model training to mitigate the effects of the class imbalance problem in local data. To address the data heterogeneity issue from multiple participants, we optimize the classical federated learning algorithm by applying knowledge distillation methods. Specifically, we adjust the client-side and server-side models separately: training a global generator to generate pseudo-samples based on the local data distribution knowledge to correct the optimization direction of client-side classification models, and integrating client-side classification models' knowledge on the server side to guide the training of the global classification model. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in social bot detection in heterogeneous data scenarios. Compared to baseline methods, our approach achieves a nearly 3-10% improvement in detection accuracy when the data heterogeneity is larger. Additionally, our method achieves the specified accuracy with minimal communication rounds.

AB In fire surveillance, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices require transmitting large monitoring data frequently, which leads to huge consumption of spectrum resources. Hence, we propose an Industrial Edge Semantic Network to allow IIoT devices to send warnings through Semantic communication (SC). Thus, we should consider 1) data privacy and security; 2) SC model adaptation for heterogeneous devices; 3) explainability of semantics. Therefore, first, we present an eXplainable Semantic Federated Learning (XSFL) to train the SC model, thus ensuring data privacy and security. Then, we present an adaptive client training strategy to provide a specific SC model for each device according to its Fisher information matrix, thus overcoming the heterogeneity. Next, an Explainable SC mechanism is designed, which introduces a leakyReLU-based activation mapping to explain the relationship between the extracted semantics and monitoring data. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of XSFL.

AB The emergence of connected vehicles via Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) has revolutionized transportation but has also brought forth challenges in security and privacy due to their open architecture. Early detection of intrusions within VANETs is paramount for ensuring safe communication. This research presents an intelligent distributed approach that leverages federated learning (FL) and blockchain for intrusion detection in VANETs. Through FL, various neural network models were implemented to distribute model training among vehicles, thus preserving privacy. Quantitative evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. For example, compared to a traditionally trained Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) model, the Federated Trained Model achieved higher precision across various attack types, ranging from 68 % to 94 %, and consistently outperformed in terms of recall, with rates ranging from 57 % to 88 %. These results highlight FL's superiority in detecting intrusions, evidenced by gains in accuracy, recall, and precision. Integration of FL with blockchain further strengthened security and privacy protection, ensuring data integrity during collaborative FL training across decentralized nodes. This novel framework addresses VANET vulnerabilities by facilitating privacy-preserving, collaborative anomaly monitoring in a trustworthy manner. Evaluations validate the performance advantages of FL for intrusion identification, supporting wider adoption of vehicular technologies. The study underscores the potential of combining FL and blockchain to enable robust, cooperative abnormality recognition crucial for maintaining reliability, safety, and trust in VANET operations.

AB Task offloading (TO) is beneficial to reducing the delay and energy consumption for the prosperity of the applications in next generation (NG) wireless networks. However, existing TO approaches are inability to exhibit low complexity and stable performance. To this end, a novel federated hierarchical deep deterministic policy gradient (FHDDPG) algorithm for TO and resource allocation (RA) is proposed in this article. To be specific, three deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) modules are deployed in parallel to make offloading decision on the execution mode of tasks and the proportion allocation of the transmission rate. Subsequently, a federated learning method is proposed to collaboratively train the HDDPG model by means of sharing models' weights. Meanwhile, the delay and the energy consumption are comprehensively considered as the average system consumption, which is defined as a reward metric of FHDDPG. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal. The experimental results indicate that the average system consumption of FHDDPG is cut down by 11.4% and 18% compare with HDDPG and DDPG, respectively, which means FHDDPG can achieve a better performance effectively.

AB Federated learning allows edge devices to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local private data. Yet, with limited network bandwidth at the edge, communication often becomes a severe bottleneck. In this article, we find that it is unnecessary to always synchronize the full model in the entire training process, because many parameters already become mature (i.e., stable) prior to model convergence, and can thus be excluded from later synchronizations. This allows us to reduce the communication overhead without compromising the model accuracy. However, challenges are that the local parameters excluded from global synchronization may diverge on different clients, and meanwhile some parameters may stabilize only temporally. To address these challenges, we propose a novel scheme called Adaptive Parameter Freezing (APF), which fixes (freezes) the non-synchronized stable parameters in intermittent periods. Specifically, the freezing periods are tentatively adjusted in an additively-increase and multiplicatively-decrease manner-depending on whether the previously-frozen parameters remain stable in subsequent iterations. We also extend APF into APF# and APF++, which freeze parameters in a more aggressive manner to achieve larger performance benefit for large complex models. We implemented APF and its variants as Python modules with PyTorch, and extensive experiments show that APF can reduce data transfer amount by over $60\%$60%.

AB In this article, an efficient federated learning (FL) Framework in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is studied. In the considered model, vehicle users implement an FL algorithm by training their local FL models and sending their models to a base station (BS) that generates a global FL model through the model aggregation. Since each user owns data samples with diverse sizes and different quality, it is necessary for the BS to select the proper participating users to acquire a better global model. Meanwhile, considering the high computational overhead of existing selection methods based on the gradient, the lightweight user selection scheme based on the loss decay is proposed. Due to the limited wireless bandwidth, the BS needs to select an suitable subset of users to implement the FL algorithm. Moreover, the vehicle users' computing resource that can be used for FL training is usually limited in the IoV when other multiple tasks are required to be executed. The local model training and model parameter transmission of FL will have significant effects on the latency of FL. To address this issue, the joint communication and computing optimization problem is formulated whose objective is to minimize the FL delay in the resource-constrained system. To solve the complex nonconvex problem, an algorithm based on the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) is proposed, which can achieve superior performance in the small-scale and delay-insensitive FL system. Due to the fact that the convergence rate of CCCP method is too slow in a large-scale FL system, this method is not suitable for delay-sensitive applications. To solve this issue, a block coordinate descent algorithm based on the one-step projected gradient method is proposed to decrease the complexity of the solution at the cost of light performance degrading. Simulations are conducted and numerical results show the good performance of the proposed methods.

AB Scheduling multiple federated learning (FL) models within a distributed network, especially in large-scale scenarios, poses significant challenges since it involves solving NP-hard mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. However, it's imperative to optimize participant selection and learning rate determination for these FL models to avoid excessive training costs and prevent resource contention. While some existing methods focus solely on optimizing a single global FL model, others struggle to achieve optimal solutions as the problem grows more complex. In this paper, exploiting the potential of quantum computing, we introduce the Hybrid Quantum-Classical Benders' Decomposition (HQCBD) algorithm to effectively tackle the joint MINLP optimization problem for multi-model FL training. HQCBD combines quantum and classical computing to solve the joint participant selection and learning scheduling problem. It decomposes the optimization problem into a master problem with binary variables and small subproblems with continuous variables, then leverages the strengths of both quantum and classical computing to solve them respectively and iteratively. Furthermore, we propose the Hybrid Quantum-Classical Multiple-cuts Benders' Decomposition (MBD) algorithm, which utilizes the inherent capabilities of quantum algorithms to produce multiple cuts in each round, to speed up the proposed HQCBD algorithm. Extensive simulation on the commercial quantum annealing machine demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods (both HQCBD and MBD), with improvements of up to 70.3% in iterations and 81% in computation time over the classical Benders' decomposition algorithm on classical CPUs, even at modest scales.

AB Patient activities' monitoring is a promising application of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), revolutionizing clinical diagnosis. An IoMT uses sensory data collected from smart devices to train a model on the server. The trained model recognizes the patient activities on smart devices. However, training the model on the server has raised privacy concerns and security threats. The sensitive medical data transferred from the smart devices to the Cloud poses different cybersecurity challenges, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS), phishing, network penetration, and side-channel. This article proposes a secure patient monitoring system using federated learning (FL). The system performs training on local devices and sends only weight matrices to the server for aggregation; thus, it preserves data privacy and security compromises. The system intelligently divides the participants into clusters based on the available resources, trains suitable models on each cluster, and enhances the performance via knowledge distillation (KD). The model of high-performing clusters distills knowledge to the model of small-size clusters to improve their performance. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed system successfully work in the presence of unequal resources.

AB Federated learning (FL) enables a large number of edge devices to learn a shared model without data sharing collaboratively. However, the imbalanced data distribution among users poses challenges to the convergence performance of FL. Group-based FL is a novel framework to improve FL performance, which appropriately groups users and allows localized aggregations within the group before a global aggregation. Nevertheless, most existing Group-based FL methods are K-means-based approaches that need to explicitly specify the number of groups, which may severely reduce the efficacy and optimality of the proposed solutions. In this paper, we propose a grouping mechanism called Auto-Group, which can automatically group users without specifying the number of groups. Specifically, various grouping strategies with different numbers of groups are generated with our mechanism. In particular, equipped with an optimized Genetic Algorithm, Auto-Group ensures that the data distribution of each group is similar to the global distribution, further reducing the communication delay. We conduct extensive experiments in various settings to evaluate Auto-Group. Experimental results show that, compared with the baselines, our mechanism can significantly improve the model accuracy while accelerating the training speed.

AB In this paper, we study multi-residential energy scheduling to minimize total energy costs while satisfying energy demands, where each residence has an energy management system (EMS) that equips energy storage and renewable energy sources and is connected to on-grid energy sources with time-of-use (TOU) and demand charge (DC) tariffs. To this end, we first develop a novel TOU and DC-aware energy scheduling (TDAS) algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (RL). It learns the policy for a single EMS which optimally determines the amount of on-grid energy consumption considering its stored energy, system uncertainties, and both tariffs without requiring any a priori information about the uncertainties. Based on the TDAS algorithm, we develop a cooperative multi-residential TDAS (Co-TDAS) algorithm using federated RL. In the algorithm, each EMS cooperatively learns a central policy that can be used for any EMS with diverse environments and utilizes it distributedly. Through simulations with real datasets, we demonstrate that our TDAS algorithm achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines with perfect a priori information. Moreover, it outperforms the baselines even with small errors on the information. We also show that the Co-TDAS algorithm learns the policy that can be utilized in different EMSs, even in newly arrived ones, and accelerates its learning speed via cooperative learning.

AB With the rapid development of healthcare-based cyber physical systems (CPSs), more and more healthcare data is collected from clinical institutions or hospitals. Due to the private and fragmented nature, healthcare data is quite suitable to be processed by federated learning (FL) paradigm, where a shared global model is aggregated by a central server while keeping the sensitive healthcare data in local hospitals. However, there are two practical issues: (1) the centralized FL server may not honestly aggregate the final model, and (2) the FL participants lack incentive to contribute their efforts. In this study, we propose a blockchain-empowered FL framework for healthcare-based CPSs. A distributed ledger is maintained by a task agreement committee which is composed by the representators of the hospitals who execute FL tasks. A secure FL task model training-based consensus process is proposed to generate consistent blocks. Furthermore, a contribution point-based incentive mechanism is designed to fairly reward FL participators for contributing their local data. We evaluate the proposed system base on real healthcare data and the numerical results demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving FL model aggregation truthfulness and efficiency in providing incentives for FL participants.

AB Federated learning (FL) enables multiple worker devices share local models trained on their private data to collaboratively train a machine learning model. However, local models are proved to imply the information about the private data and, thus, introduce much vulnerabilities to inference attacks where the adversary reconstructs or infers the sensitive information about the private data (e.g., labels, memberships, etc.) from the local models. To address this issue, existing works proposed homomorphic encryption, secure multiparty computation (SMC), and differential privacy methods. Nevertheless, the homomorphic encryption and SMC-based approaches are not applicable to large-scale FL scenarios as they incur substantial additional communication and computation costs and require secure channels to delivery keys. Moreover, differential privacy brings a substantial tradeoff between privacy budget and model performance. In this article, we propose a novel FL framework, which can protect the data privacy of worker devices against the inference attacks with minimal accuracy cost and low computation and communication cost, and does not rely on the secure pairwise communication channels. The main idea is to generate the lightweight keys based on computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) problem to encrypt the local models, and the FL server can only get the sum of the local models of all worker devices without knowing the exact local model of any specific worker device. The extensive experimental results on three real-world data sets validate that the proposed FL framework can protect the data privacy of worker devices, and only incurs a small constant of computation and communication cost and a drop in test accuracy of no more than 1%.

AB In recent years, Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) have emerged as a critical technology to enable a diverse range of Location-based Services (LBS) across different sectors, such as retail, healthcare, and transportation. Despite their strong demand and importance, existing implementations of IPS face significant challenges concerning accuracy and privacy. The accuracy issue is mainly rooted in the inherent characteristics of Received Signal Strength (RSS), which is widely integrated into current IPS as it only requires readily available WiFi infrastructure. Several studies have demonstrated that RSS suffers from instability and inaccuracy in the presence of environmental changes, making it an inadequate choice for precise IPS. Furthermore, most state-of-the-art IPS encounter privacy and data security issues as they often require users to share their privacy-sensitive location data with a centralized server. Unfortunately, centralized data collection and processing potentially expose users to privacy breaches. To tackle these shortcomings, we advocate for a comprehensive, accurate, and multifaceted solution that enables users to harness the benefits of IPS without provoking privacy concerns. First, we address the positional inaccuracy problem by combining the strengths and synergies between RSS and Channel State Information (CSI). Fusing these complementary metrics delivers increased stability against environmental fluctuations. Thereby, it provides a robust foundation for reliable and accurate positioning outcomes. Second, to address the privacy challenge, we integrate Federated Learning (FL) into the proposed solution to enable the collaborative development of machine learning-based IPS models while ensuring that user data remains decentralized. We conducted a comprehensive assessment to evaluate the performance of the proposed IPS and the corresponding overheads compared to established baseline techniques that utilize either RSS or CSI independently. The results indicate significant enhancements, highlighting our solution's ability to effectively address accuracy and privacy challenges.

   Collusion-attack resistant; Post-quantum security
AB To ensure no private information is leaked in the aggregation phase in federated learning (FL), many frameworks use homomorphic encryption (HE) to mask local model updates. However, the heavy overheads of these frameworks make them unsuitable for cross-device FL, where the clients are a huge number of mobile and edge devices with limited computing resources. Even worse, some of them also fail to manage the dynamic changes of clients. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a threshold multi-key HE scheme tMK-CKKS and design an efficient and robust privacy-preserving FL framework. Robustness means that our framework allows clients to join in or drop out during the training process. Besides, because our tMK-CKKS scheme can pack multiple messages in a single ciphertext, our framework significantly reduces the computation and communication overhead. Moreover, the threshold mechanism in tMK-CKKS ensures that our framework can resist collusion attacks between the server and no more than t (threshold value) curious internal clients. Finally, we implement our framework in FedML and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our framework. Utility evaluations on 6 benchmark datasets show that our framework can protect privacy without sacrificing the model accuracy. Efficiency evaluations on 4 typical deep learning models demonstrate that: our framework can speed up the computation by at least 1.21x over xMK-CKKS-based framework, 15.84x over Batchcrypt-based framework, and 20.30x over CRT-Paillier-based framework. Our framework can reduce the communication burden by at least 8.61 MB over Batchcrypt-based framework, 35.36 MB over xMK-CKKS-based framework and 42.58 MB over CRT-Paillier-based framework. The advantages in both computation and communication expand with the size of deep learning models.

AB Federated learning (FL) enables multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices to collaboratively train a global model without centralizing raw data. However, achieving optimal performance for each device is challenging due to the heterogeneity of IoT data. Moreover, IoT devices, constrained in computational power and energy, necessitate innovative privacy protection solutions in FL. In this article, we propose privacy-enhanced FL methods to address data heterogeneity in IoT. Our approach includes a dual-model framework for each device, combining a shared model to facilitate interclient communication with a personalized model. This personalized model is developed from local aggregation, utilizing layer-wise aggregation weights generated by local hypernetworks. This integration effectively balances collective intelligence with client-specific knowledge, addressing data heterogeneity for improved personalization. Additionally, we propose a local gradient shielding (LGS) method to protect training data. This method conceals gradients in locally trained personalized models, preventing data reconstruction and ensuring client privacy with minimal resource consumption. Extensive evaluations on benchmark data sets, showcasing various types and degrees of data heterogeneity, demonstrate the superiority of our approaches over current baselines.

AB The advancement of the sensing capabilities of end devices drives a variety of data-intensive insights, yielding valuable information for modelling intelligent industrial applications. To apply intelligent models in 5G and beyond, edge intelligence integrates edge computing systems and deep learning solutions, which enables distributed model training and inference. Edge federated learning (EFL) offers collaborative edge intelligence learning with distributed aggregation capabilities, promoting resource efficiency, participant inclusivity, and privacy preservation. However, the quality of service (QoS) faces challenges due to congestion problems that arise from the diverse models and data in practical architectures. In this paper, we develop a modified long short-term memory (LSTM)-based congestion-aware EFL (MLSTM-CEFL) approach that aims to enhance QoS in the final model convergence between end devices, edge aggregators, and the global server. Given the diversity of service types, MLSTM-CEFL proactively detects the congestion rates, adequately schedules the edge aggregations, and effectively prioritizes high mission-critical serving resources. The proposed system is formulated to handle time series analysis from local/edge model parameter loading, weighing the configuration of resource pooling properties at specific congestion intervals. The MLSTM-CEFL policy orchestrates the establishment of long-term paths for participant-aggregator scheduling and follows the expected QoS metrics after final averaging in multiple industrial application classes.

AB With the development of edge computing and artificial intelligence technology, edge federated learning (EFL) has been widely applied in the Internet of Vehicles (IOV) due to its distributed characteristics and advantages in privacy protection. In this paper, we study the mobile computing power trading between edge servers (ES) and mobile vehicle-mounted equipment (MVE) in the IOV scene. In order to reduce the influence of MVEs' flexibility, which can easily lead to single point failure or offline problem, we propose semi-synchronous FL aggregation. Considering that multiple federated learning (FL) tasks have different budgets and MVEs have different computing resources, we design an incentive mechanism to encourage selfish MVEs to actively participate in FL task training, so as to obtain higher quality FL models. Furthermore, we propose a fast association decision method based on dynamic state space Markov decision process (DSS-MDP). Simulation experiment data show that, MVEs can obtain higher quality local models at the same energy consumption, thus gaining higher utility. Semi-synchronous FL aggregation is able to improve the accuracy of FL global model by 0.764% on average and reduce the idle time of MVEs by 90.44% compared with the way of allocating aggregation weights according to the data volume.

AB Detecting anomalous inputs is essential in many mission-critical systems in various domains, particularly cybersecurity. In particular, deep neural network-based anomaly detection methods have been successful for anomaly detection tasks with the recent advancements in deep learning technology. Nevertheless, the existing methods have considered somewhat idealized problems where it is enough to learn a single detector based on a single dataset. In this paper, we consider a more practical problem where multiple hosts in an organization collect their input data, while data sharing among the hosts is prohibitive due to security reasons, and only a few of them have experienced abnormal inputs. Furthermore, the data distribution of the hosts can be skewed; for example, a particular type of input can be observed by a limited subset of hosts. We propose the federated hypersphere classifier (FHC), which is a new anomaly detection method based on an improved hypersphere classifier suited for running in the federated learning framework to perform anomaly detection in such an environment. Our experiments with image and network intrusion detection datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods trained in a host-wise fashion by learning a consensus model as if we have accessed the input data from all hosts but without communicating such data.

AB Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique, where each device contributes to the learning model by independently computing the gradient based on its local training data. It has recently become a hot research topic, as it promises several benefits related to data privacy and scalability. However, implementing FL at the network edge is challenging due to system and data heterogeneity and resource constraints. In this article, we examine the existing challenges and trade-offs in Federated Edge Learning (FEEL). The design of FEEL algorithms for resources-efficient learning raises several challenges. These challenges are essentially related to the multidisciplinary nature of the problem. As the data is the key component of the learning, this article advocates a new set of considerations for data characteristics in wireless scheduling algorithms in FEEL. Hence, we propose a general framework for data-aware scheduling as a guideline for future research directions. We also discuss the main axes and requirements for data evaluation and some exploitable techniques and metrics.

AB The rapid advancement in technology has simplified human life and provides convenience. However, this convenience has led to many lifestyle diseases like diabetes and obesity. The 2021 reports of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) show 537 million diabetics, three-fourths of whom are from developing countries. About 28.5% of these diabetics over 40 suffer from Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), 4.4% face vision-threatening DR, and 3.8% suffer from Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). These conditions can lead to complete vision loss affecting health and quality of life. Early detection of DR and DME is crucial to prevent harmful effects. The proposed work employs a collaborative, privacy-preserving Federated Deep Learning (FDL) framework with lightweight MobileNetV2 architecture for early detection of DR and DME. The proposed FDL framework uses both Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID data for 2 and 3-client architectures. In a 2-client scenario, the FDL implementation with FedAvg aggregation achieved 98.69% accuracy on IID data and 87.09% on non-IID data, while FedProx aggregation scored 98.03% on IID data and 98.25% on non-IID data. In a 3-client scenario, FedAvg aggregation achieved 97.62% accuracy on IID data and 96.28% on non-IID data, whereas FedProx aggregation achieved 98.69% on IID data and 97.77% on non-IID data. The results demonstrate that the FedProx aggregation is more stable and converges earlier than FedAvg aggregation in the non-IID settings of an FDL framework. The proposed FDL framework with its collaborative training feature, preserves privacy and maintains high prediction accuracy.

AB Internet of Everything (IoE) is playing key role to enable smart energy management in buildings. A huge amount of load data are accumulated continuously to control the energy systems inside buildings. Big data analysis and prediction play increasingly vital roles in making the building energy systems smarter. Meanwhile, the big data forecasting technique represents the key element for an efficient energy con-trol mechanism in buildings. However, the load forecast models require a huge amount of consumption data with enough variety to achieve high accuracy. Moreover, the collected IoE data are privacy-sensitive. That is, the fine-grained load data collected at the level of buildings may reveal information about the occupant's behaviors. In this paper, by using Federating Learning (FL) as a decentralized machine learning technique, buildings occupants' information can efficiently participate in the decision-making without re-vealing privacy through a cloud/Edge computing framework. In the FL approach, the big data are widely distributed between buildings, where a shared learning model is trained locally on each of the buildings. Nonetheless, the FL approach does not provide provable privacy guarantees. Moreover, FL requires partici-pating buildings to regularly exchange huge updates resulting in huge bandwidth consumption. The paper presents a new privacy-preserving bandwidth-efficient FL that relies on Differential Privacy to theoreti-cally provide privacy. Furthermore, to ensure the fast convergence of the FL model, a POWER-SELECTION protocol is introduced to select between buildings to participate in the FL round. By numerical analysis, the proposed FL approach is demonstrated to improve the accuracy of load forecast while compromising provable privacy. (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In federated learning for VANET, Yuan et al. proposed a privacy-enhanced authentication protocol to balance training efficiency and vehicle privacy. They claimed that their protocol provides both unforgeability and traceability, asserting that it is secure against unforgeable attacks from Type I adversaries and allows Trust Authorities (TAs) to trace the real identities of malicious vehicles. Unfortunately, our analysis reveals that Yuan et al.'s protocol is insecure in the presence of malicious vehicles. Specifically, malicious vehicles can forge the signatures of arbitrary messages through public key replacement attacks by Type I adversaries. Furthermore, the real identities of malicious vehicles cannot be effectively traced. Consequently, the authenticity and integrity of the collected model parameters cannot be guaranteed. After analyzing the reasons for these vulnerabilities, we offer corresponding suggestions to overcome them.

AB Edge computing architectures can help us quickly process the data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) and caching files to edge nodes can speed up the response speed of IoT devices requesting files. Blockchain architectures can help us ensure the security of data transmitted by IoT. Therefore, we have proposed a system that combines IoT devices, edge nodes, remote cloud, and blockchain. In the system, we designed a new algorithm in which blockchain-assisted compressed algorithm of federated learning is applied for content caching, called CREAT to predict cached files. In the CREAT algorithm, each edge node uses local data to train a model and then uses the model to learn the features of users and files, so as to predict popular files to improve the cache hit rate. In order to ensure the security of edge nodes' data, we use federated learning (FL) to enable multiple edge nodes to cooperate in training without sharing data. In addition, for the purpose of reducing communication load in FL, we will compress gradients uploaded by edge nodes to reduce the time required for communication. What is more, in order to ensure the security of the data transmitted in the CREAT algorithm, we have incorporated blockchain technology in the algorithm. We design four smart contracts for decentralized entities to record and verify the transactions to ensure the security of data. We used MovieLens data sets for experiments and we can see that CREAT greatly improves the cache hit rate and reduces the time required to upload data.

Among others, the framework of federated edge learning (FEEL) is popular for its data-privacy preservation. FEEL coordinates global model training at an edge server and local model training at devices that are connected by wireless links. This work contributes to the energy-efficient implementation of FEEL in wireless networks by designing joint computation-and-communication resource management ((CRM)-R-2). The design targets the state-of-the-art heterogeneous mobile architecture where parallel computing using both CPU and GPU, called heterogeneous computing, can significantly improve both the performance and energy efficiency. To minimize the sum energy consumption of devices, we propose a novel (CRM)-R-2 framework featuring multi-dimensional control including bandwidth allocation, CPU-GPU workload partitioning and speed scaling at each device, and C-2 time division for each link. The key component of the framework is a set of equilibriums in energy rates with respect to different control variables that are proved to exist among devices or between processing units at each device. The results are applied to designing efficient algorithms for computing the optimal (CRM)-R-2 policies faster than the standard optimization tools. Based on the equilibriums, we further design energy-efficient schemes for device scheduling and greedy spectrum sharing that scavenges "spectrum holes" resulting from heterogeneous C-2 time divisions among devices. Using a real dataset, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of (CRM)-R-2 on improving the energy efficiency of a FEEL system.

AB With the coming of the industrial Big Data era, data-driven fault diagnosis models emerge recently and show potential results in many studies. However, it is impractical to collect massive high-quality data in actual industrial applications, which strongly reduces the performance of fault diagnosis models. Therefore, multiple data owners are motivated to share their own data for training a brilliant model with the aggregated dataset. Notwithstanding, it is unrealistic to share data due to the potential conflict of interest. For addressing the issue of data island, a new federated framework namely FedCAE is proposed for fault diagnosis. In this framework, each client is equipped with a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) trained by its corresponding local data. Then, all CAEs are uploaded to a server and aggregated to a global CAE according to an adaptive weighted selection mechanism. Afterwards, the global CAE is downloaded to all clients for extracting low-level features from local datasets by its encoder and uploading these features to train a global fault diagnosis classifier in the server. At last, the classifier is downloaded to all clients for completing their own diagnosis tasks. Experiment results on two bearing datasets suggest FedCAE offers a promising solution on confidential decentralized learning.

AB As renewable energy resources increasingly integrate and dynamic user loads emerge, precise short-term forecasting across various scenarios becomes crucial for the efficient operation of modern power systems. Federated learning (FL) presents an effective solution for forecasting that safeguards privacy and security through model aggregation without sharing sensitive raw data. In the Electric Internet of Things (EIoT), the heterogeneity of clients can complicate model convergence, challenging the efficiency of the current federated averaging (FedAvg)-based methods. To address this, our analysis of regression challenges within the EIoT and the unique attributes of FL methods has led to the development of a novel algorithm: federated mutual knowledge distillation learning for regression (FedMR), aiming to deliver superior forecasting precision and efficiency at a reduced cost. FedMR utilizes the models and min-max labels from distributed clients, enabling its embedded generator to assimilate global knowledge and synthesize data in a normal distribution pattern. This feature enhances training across a spectrum of user environments. Demonstrated through testing on three open EIoT data sets, FedMR showcases high efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability across diverse client participation scenarios. Additionally, our research delves into the application of FedMR in managing device heterogeneity, a common issue in the EIoT systems. By focusing on sharing only the regression layers of clients, our proposed FedMRL(ightweight) pioneers a model-agnostic aggregation approach in short-term forecasting, effectively achieving a harmonized balance of accuracy and efficiency.

AB Decentralized federated learning (DFL), a federated edge learning (FEEL) framework without a server, can avoid the huge communication overhead of the server and the single point of failure within FEEL. Since, there is no server, the convergence of DFL depends not only on the communication conditions and number of edge nodes but also on the graph topology of the network over which edge nodes communicate. Moreover, in practical scenarios, considering the limited communication resources, such as the latency and energy costs, the convergence of DFL also suffers from the quantization errors. In this article, we consider the decentralized gradient descent (DGD), which is widely applied in DFL, and examine the influence of the graph topology and quantization on the convergence of DGD in different wireless networks with the cost constraints. According to the derived convergence bound, the maximum quantization error acceptable for the DFL convergence is obtained. Furthermore, motivated by the limited iterations caused by the impact of constrained communication costs on the each edge node, we compare the convergence bounds between the higher and lower connectivity topologies, which face different energy consumption in one round of communication. Based on this comparison, the impact of the graph topologies with the energy constraints on the convergence can be observed. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of our analyses, supporting the correctness of our theoretical findings.

ID POISONING ATTACKS; EFFICIENT
AB In recent years, the notion of "the right to be forgotten" (RTBF) has become a crucial aspect of data privacy for digital trust and AI safety, requiring the provision of mechanisms that support the removal of personal data of individuals upon their requests. Consequently, machine unlearning (MU) has gained considerable attention which allows an ML model to selectively eliminate identifiable information. Evolving from MU, federated unlearning (FU) has emerged to confront the challenge of data erasure within federated learning (FL) settings, which empowers the FL model to unlearn an FL client or identifiable information pertaining to the client. Nevertheless, the distinctive attributes of federated learning introduce specific challenges for FU techniques. These challenges necessitate a tailored design when developing FU algorithms. While various concepts and numerous federated unlearning schemes exist in this field, the unified workflow and tailored design of FU are not yet well understood. Therefore, this comprehensive survey delves into the techniques and methodologies in FU providing an overview of fundamental concepts and principles, evaluating existing federated unlearning algorithms, and reviewing optimizations tailored to federated learning. Additionally, it discusses practical applications and assesses their limitations. Finally, it outlines promising directions for future research.

   strategies; privacy-preserving; N-IID
AB Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a machine learning approach to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model. Although, during FL training, only a subset of workers participate in each round, existing approaches introduce model bias when considering the average of local model parameters of heterogeneous workers, which degrades the accuracy of the learned global model. In this paper, we introduce NIFL, a new strategy for worker selection that handles the statistical challenges of FL when local data is Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (N-IID). In NIFL, the server starts sending the signal to the workers that react by sending the number of their samples. The server then selects a percentage of workers with the highest number of samples and requests data statistics such as mean and standard deviation. After that, the server calculates our proposed N-IID index, based on the statistical information collected from the workers without having access to their data, and uses this index as a criterion for worker selection. Finally, the server broadcasts the global model to the selected workers. NIFL takes into account the disparity in the distribution of workers' data in order to improve the performance of the model in heterogeneous data environment. We have performed several experiments with N-IID data. The obtained results show that both the convergence of our method and the test accuracy increased considerably comparing to the other techniques while keeping a reasonable computation and communication costs.

AB Due to the recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies, the detection and prevention of intrusions in enterprise networks have become a crucial and challenging task. Real-time monitoring of network traffic and resources is required to protect those networks from intrusions. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) analyses the data packets from the network and the system-level applications to detect any malicious activity. However, existing IDSs require all the data, collected at different network nodes, to be collated at one central location to perform the analysis for any model development. This approach hampers the data privacy at the network nodes as the data needs to be shared with other nodes. Furthermore, many of the existing IDSs are unable to adapt to evolving attack patterns, which may result in poor network vulnerability detection and significant degradation in the performance of the systems. To address these limitations, we present a Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning-based IDS in which multiple agents are deployed on the network in a distributed fashion, and each of these agents runs a Deep Q-Network logic. We considered the data privacy concerns of each agent while designing the system. In our system, the data at each agent node is not shared with any other nodes. At the same time, however, all the agents in the system benefit, via the attention weighted model aggregation process, from the distribution and pattern of the data available at all the other agents. We have also developed an attention mechanism that dynamically determines attention value of an agent, which is used in the model aggregation process. Our model can be scaled to large networks and is resistant to hardware or network failures at any agent node. We have tested and evaluated our proposed system on the cloud-based ISOT-CID dataset and the standard benchmark NSL-KDD dataset. The experimental findings demonstrate the performance and robustness of our proposed model in terms of metrics like accuracy, precision, false-positive rate, and area under the ROC curve.

TI Federated learning using model projection for multi-center disease

DE Federated learning; Multi-center disease diagnosis; Non-IID data;
   Catastrophic forgetting; Invalid aggregation
AB Multi -center disease diagnosis aims to build a global model for all involved medical centers. Due to privacy concerns, it is infeasible to collect data from multiple centers for training (i.e., centralized learning). Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized framework that enables multiple clients (e.g., medical centers) to collaboratively train a global model while retaining patient data locally for privacy. However, in practice, the data across medical centers are not independently and identically distributed (Non-IID), causing two challenging issues: (1) catastrophic forgetting at clients, i.e., the local model at clients will forget the knowledge received from the global model after local training, causing reduced performance; and (2) invalid aggregation at the server, i.e., the global model at the server may not be favorable to some clients after model aggregation, resulting in a slow convergence rate. To mitigate these issues, an innovative Fed erated learning using Mo del Projection (FedMoP) is proposed, which guarantees: (1) the loss of local model on global data does not increase after local training without accessing the global data so that the performance will not be degenerated; and (2) the loss of global model on local data does not increase after aggregation without accessing local data so that convergence rate can be improved. Extensive experimental results show that our FedMoP outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in terms of accuracy, convergence rate and communication cost. In particular, our FedMoP also achieves comparable or even higher accuracy than centralized learning. Thus, our FedMoP can ensure privacy protection while outperforming centralized learning in accuracy and communication cost.

ID DISTRIBUTED CONTROL
AB Privacy preservation in data -driven modeling of a heterogeneous nonlinear system with multiple subsystems has become vitally important since communication data is vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This work develops a federated learning (FL) modeling and model predictive control (MPC) method for heterogeneous nonlinear systems with multiple subsystems to address privacy preservation and heterogeneity issues. The FL framework with two different neural network structures is developed to aggregate the submodels trained locally for the subsystems into a global model without sharing the local data with each other. Subsequently, a theoretical bound on the generalization error of the FL models is established using information theory. The closed -loop stability criteria of heterogeneous nonlinear systems under the FL -based MPC scheme are developed in an information -theoretical manner. Finally, a chemical process network is applied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FL modeling and FL -based MPC methods.

AB Cerebellar ataxia (CA) is concerned with the incoordination of movement caused by cerebellar dysfunction. Movements of the eyes, speech, trunk, and limbs are affected. Conventional machine learning approaches utilizing centralised databases have been used to objectively diagnose and quantify the severity of CA. Although these approaches achieved high accuracy, large scale deployment will require large clinics and raises privacy concerns. In this study, we propose an image transformation-based approach to leverage the advantages of state-of-the-art deep learning with federated learning in diagnosing CA. We use motion capture sensors during the performance of a standard neurological balance test obtained from four geographically separated clinics. The recurrence plot, melspectrogram, and poincare plot are three transformation techniques explored. Experimental results indicate that the recurrence plot yields the highest validation accuracy (86.69%) with MobileNetV2 model in diagnosing CA. The proposed scheme provides a practical solution with high diagnosis accuracy, removing the need for feature engineering and preserving data privacy for a large-scale deployment.

AB The transport and supply of traditional energy have been greatly affected, which has attracted the attention of countries worldwide and has become an urgent issue. Limited by its own traditional energy shortage and relying on many imported energy raw materials, Taiwan has gradually transformed natural resources into abundant renewable energy through energy transformation, of which wind power has increased up to 1.79 %. It mainly relies on the operation of wind turbines to convert wind power energy into electricity, so the operation of wind turbines is an important issue to maintain stable power collection. This study mainly discusses the wind turbine failure prediction model based on the supervisory control and monitoring system (SCADA) data of 31 wind turbines, and used deep learning and federated learning architecture combined with differential privacy method to find the most suitable model combination through experiments, and establishes wind turbines for state assessment of failure architecture with transmission and prediction, so as to improve wind turbine efficiency and reduce maintenance costs. The proposed method uses 1-dimensional convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory denoising autoencoder with the transformer (Conv1D-BiLSTM-DAE-TF) for feature compression, and then uses 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (Conv1D), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) model for abnormal detection with state assessment. Combined with federated learning and differential privacy architecture for wind turbine failure prediction it can effectively predict performance and privacy security. The results show that it has the best for feature compression convergence performance and fault prediction based on differential privacy for protect model, and construction of models between different wind turbine equipment through the platform.

ID WIRELESS EDGE
AB Over-the-air computation (OAC) is a promising technique to realize fast model aggregation in the uplink of federated edge learning (FEEL). OAC, however, hinges on accurate channel-gain precoding and strict synchronization among edge devices, which are challenging in practice. As such, how to design the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator in the presence of residual channel-gain mismatch and asynchronies is an open problem. To fill this gap, this paper formulates the problem of misaligned OAC for FEEL and puts forth a whitened matched filtering and sampling scheme to obtain oversampled, but independent samples from the misaligned and overlapped signals. Given the whitened samples, a sum-product ML (SP-ML) estimator and an aligned-sample estimator are devised to estimate the arithmetic sum of the transmitted symbols. In particular, the computational complexity of our SP-ML estimator is linear in the packet length, and hence is significantly lower than the conventional ML estimator. Extensive simulations on the test accuracy versus the average received energy per symbol to noise power spectral density ratio (EsN0) yield two main results: 1) In the low EsN0 regime, the aligned-sample estimator can achieve superior test accuracy provided that the phase misalignment is not severe. In contrast, the ML estimator does not work well due to the error propagation and noise enhancement in the estimation process. 2) In the high EsN0 regime, the ML estimator attains the optimal learning performance regardless of the severity of phase misalignment. On the other hand, the aligned-sample estimator suffers from a test-accuracy loss caused by phase misalignment.

AB Federated Learning (FL) is a paradigm in distributed machine learning, which has gained significant attention in the recent years especially in the domain of Internet of Things. Federated Learning saves communication bandwidth when compared to centralized machine learning process and is also considered to be privacy preserving as the raw data at the clients need not be transmitted to the server for the FL learning. Recent studies on FL have exposed privacy vulnerabilities particularly in the form of Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLA) in which the adversaries can generate training data of the client from shared gradients or model updates from clients. The available solutions in the literature for GLA based on perturbing the gradients from clients leads to a drop in the performance of the FL system while attempting to preserve privacy. We propose HAFedL, an improved novel hessian aware adaptive privacy preserving FL scheme in which the performance of the model is not significantly affected due to the aspects introduced in the FL architecture to improve the privacy of the model against the GLA. The HAFedL is also robust to the data heterogeneity and device heterogeneity (particularly straggler effect) which may be present in the clients participating in the FL.

AB Multi-agent systems enable the division of complicated tasks into individual objects that can cooperate. Such architecture can be useful in building solutions in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). In this paper, we propose an architecture of such a system that ensures the security of private data, as well as allows the addition and/or modification of the used classification methods. The main advantages of the proposed system are based on the implementation of blockchain technology elements and threaded federated learning. The individual elements are located on the agents who exchange information. Additionally, we propose building an agent with a consortium mechanism for classification results from many machine learning solutions. This proposal offers a new model of agents that can be implemented as a system for processing medical data in real-time. Our proposition was described and tested to present advantages over other, existing state-of-the-art methods. We show, that this proposition can improve the Internet of Medical Thing solutions by presenting a new idea of a multi-agent system that can separate different tasks like security, or classification and as a result minimize operation time and increase accuracy.

AB Using multi-task learning to extract code features can effectively increase the information of the features. However, the existing multi-task learning methods mainly have two limitations: (1) They cannot extract enough code-related information or only extract similar semantic features. Similar multi-task makes the information in the features increased insufficiently. However, the high difference multi-task is challenging to converge. (2) They cannot train multi-task on heterogeneous datasets. In standard multi-task training, we need to label all tasks for all data, which consumes enormous labor. To solve the above limitations, we select two high difference tasks, the cross-language code completion task and variable misuse task, to extract expressive semantic code features. We propose an attention-based feature fusion module to merge information among high difference tasks, avoiding the convergence dilemma of standard multi-task learning. We propose a federated learning framework, extracting semantic information and using the feature fusion module to integrate multi-task information among single labeled datasets. We experiment on C# and Python datasets for the code completion and variable misuse tasks. The results show that the performance of fusion features by FedMTFF improved by up to 22.6% and 15.1% compared to single tasks. We use FedMTFF to perform four cross-language multi-task features fusion, exceeding the current best baseline by 24.1%.

AB Federated learning (FL) provides a promising framework for enabling distributed machine learning based services without revealing users' private data. In the scenario of wireless FL, to counter the eavesdropping attack when the parameter-server (PS, which is co-located with a base station, BS) sends the model-data to the wireless devices, we propose a secrecy driven FL via cooperative jamming, in which wireless devices cooperatively provide jamming to the eavesdropper to enhance the PS's secure throughput based on the measure of physical layer security. We formulate a joint optimization of the PS's downloading-transmission duration, all wireless devices' uploading-transmission duration as a non-orthogonal multiple access cluster, each device's local processing-rate and transmit powers for its uploading NOMA-transmission and jamming to the eavesdropper, with the objective of minimizing the overall latency for each round of FL iteration. Despite the non-convexity of the joint optimization problem, a layered algorithm is proposed to solve it. Taking into account the special feature of the optimal jamming solution, we further propose a benefit-sharing scheme, which is based on the principle of Nash bargaining solution, such that all wireless devices can benefit from reducing the FL latency via cooperative jamming in a fairness manner. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as well as the performance advantage of our proposed secrecy driven FL via cooperative jamming. Experimental results based on the real data-sets and training models demonstrate that our scheme can reduce the latency by more than 35% compared to the case without using the jamming.

TI FedOSS: Federated Open Set Recognition via Inter-Client Discrepancy and
   Collaboration
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING
LA English
DT Article
DE Open set recognition; federated learning; medical image classification
ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Open set recognition (OSR) aims to accurately classify known diseases and recognize unseen diseases as the unknown class in medical scenarios. However, in existing OSR approaches, gathering data from distributed sites to construct large-scale centralized training datasets usually leads to high privacy and security risk, which could be alleviated elegantly via the popular cross-site training paradigm, federated learning (FL). To this end, we represent the first effort to formulate federated open set recognition (FedOSR), and meanwhile propose a novel Federated Open Set Synthesis (FedOSS) framework to address the core challenge of FedOSR: the unavailability of unknown samples for all anticipated clients during the training phase. The proposed FedOSS framework mainly leverages two modules, i.e., Discrete Unknown Sample Synthesis (DUSS) and Federated Open Space Sampling (FOSS), to generate virtual unknown samples for learning decision boundaries between known and unknown classes. Specifically, DUSS exploits inter-client knowledge inconsistency to recognize known samples near decision boundaries and then pushes them beyond decision boundaries to synthesize discrete virtual unknown samples. FOSS unites these generated unknown samples from different clients to estimate the class-conditional distributions of open data space near decision boundaries and further samples open data, thereby improving the diversity of virtual unknown samples. Additionally, we conduct comprehensive ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of DUSS and FOSS. FedOSS shows superior performance on public medical datasets in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Currently, the data collected by the Internet of Healthcare Things, i.e., healthcare oriented Internet of Things (IoT), still rely on cloud-based centralized data aggregation and processing. To reduce the need for transmission of data to the cloud, the edge computing architecture may be adopted to facilitate machine learning at the edge of the network through leveraging on the amassed computation resources of pervasive IoT devices. In this article, federated learning (FL) is proposed to enable privacy-preserving collaborative model training at the edge of the network across distributed IoT users. However, the users in the FL network may have different willingness to participate (WTP), a hidden information unknown to the model owner. Furthermore, the development of healthcare applications typically requires sustainable user participation, e.g., for the continuous collection of data during which a user's WTP may change over time. As such, we leverage on the dynamic contract design to consider a two-period incentive mechanism that satisfies the intertemporal incentive compatibility (IIC), such that the self-revealing mechanism of the contract holds across both periods. The performance evaluation shows that our contract design satisfies the IIC constraints and derives greater profits than that of the uniform pricing scheme, thus validating its effectiveness in mitigating the adverse impacts of the information asymmetry.

AB Edge caching is an emerging technology for addressing massive content access in mobile networks to support rapidly growing Internet-of-Things (IoT) services and applications. However, most current optimization-based methods lack a self-adaptive ability in dynamic environments. To tackle these challenges, current learning-based approaches are generally proposed in a centralized way. However, network resources may be overconsumed during the training and data transmission process. To address the complex and dynamic control issues, we propose a federated deep-reinforcement-learning-based cooperative edge caching (FADE) framework. FADE enables base stations (BSs) to cooperatively learn a shared predictive model by considering the first-round training parameters of the BSs as the initial input of the local training, and then uploads near-optimal local parameters to the BSs to participate in the next round of global training. Furthermore, we prove the expectation convergence of FADE. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FADE framework on reducing the performance loss and average delay, offloading backhaul traffic, and improving the hit rate.

AB Due to the greatly improved capabilities of devices, massive data, and increasing concern about data privacy, Federated Learning (FL) has been increasingly considered for applications to wireless communication networks (WCNs). Wireless FL (WFL) is a distributed method of training a global deep learning model in which a large number of participants each train a local model on their training datasets and then upload the local model updates to a central server. However, in general, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data of WCNs raises concerns about robustness, as a malicious participant could potentially inject a "backdoor" into the global model by uploading poisoned data or models over WCN. This could cause the model to misclassify malicious inputs as a specific target class while behaving normally with benign inputs. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the latest backdoor attacks and defense mechanisms. It classifies them according to their targets (data poisoning or model poisoning), the attack phase (local data collection, training, or aggregation), and defense stage (local training, before aggregation, during aggregation, or after aggregation). The strengths and limitations of existing attack strategies and defense mechanisms are analyzed in detail. Comparisons of existing attack methods and defense designs are carried out, pointing to noteworthy findings, open challenges, and potential future research directions related to security and privacy of WFL.

AB Intelligent reflective surface (IRS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication are indispensable potential technologies in the future sixth-generation mobile communication technology (6 G). Utilizing the high beamforming gain of IRS and the high mobility of UAV can achieve ubiquitous network coverage and ensure a high-quality communication environment. Wireless Powered Communication Network (WPCN) is an emerging green communication technology network that converts received radio frequency (RF) signals into electrical energy to power Federated Learning (FL) users. FL users perform local computing and model transmission through the collected energy, ensuring the sustainability of FL. In order to solve the problems of complex communication environment, privacy protection, and energy constraints on terminal devices, we design an FL system based on an IRS-assisted UAV wireless power communication network, which minimizes the UAV transmission energy by jointly optimizing UAV location, IRS phase shift, and resource allocation strategies. We use a low-complexity iterative algorithm to solve this complex non-convex problem. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is obviously better than that of other benchmark schemes, indicating that joint optimization plays an essential role in improving the performance of the system.

TI Federated learning enables privacy-preserving and data-efficient

AB A crucial part of quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is the decision to accept or reject parts based on their dimensional accuracy. Machine learning (ML) models can learn nuanced relationships between process parameters and resulting geometries; however, obtaining large quantities of supervised learning data to train ML models incurs non-trivial costs. Relevant measurement data may be available at other factories or stations within the same factory but cannot be pooled together for conventional centralized learning (CL) due to privacy constraints. Here, we propose federated learning (FL) that uses private data and information from distributed sources to train ML models that predict part dimensions and inform part qualification, thereby allowing collaborative model building without compromising privacy. We manufacture and measure 405 parts having three different designs and distribute them across three to 45 factories. The performance of FL is evaluated when factories produce similar parts, parts of different designs, and parts of different qualities. When factories produce similar parts or parts of different designs, FL predicts part geometry within 10 mu m of the CL benchmark and within 15 mu m of the process capability limit, with as few as nine parts at each factory. FL also outperforms individual learning where factories train on their own data by up to 96% in geometry prediction, thereby providing a win-win paradigm for privacy-preserving collaborative learning. When factories produce parts of different qualities, FL outperforms individual factories only when they produce less than 15 parts locally. We show that FL performance is influenced by two factors: the quantity of data in the federation and the statistical homogeneity of data across participating factories. Overall, this research demonstrates the promise of FL for privacy-preserving, data-efficient quality control and offers key insights to design data federations in scalable AM production.

TI LightFR: Lightweight Federated Recommendation with Privacy-preserving

DT Article
DE Federated recommender system; matrix factorization; privacy
   preservation; learning to hash
AB Federated recommender system (FRS), which enables many local devices to train a shared model jointly without transmitting local raw data, has become a prevalent recommendation paradigm with privacy-preserving advantages. However, previous work on FRS performs similarity search via inner product in continuous embedding space, which causes an efficiency bottleneck when the scale of items is extremely large. We argue that such a scheme in federated settings ignores the limited capacities in resource-constrained user devices (i.e., storage space, computational overhead, and communication bandwidth), and makes it harder to be deployed in large-scale recommender systems. Besides, it has been shown that transmitting local gradients in real-valued form between server and clients may leak users' private information. To this end, we propose a lightweight federated recommendation framework with privacy-preserving matrix factorization, LightFR, that is able to generate high-quality binary codes by exploiting learning to hash technique under federated settings, and thus enjoys both fast online inference and economic memory consumption. Moreover, we devise an efficient federated discrete optimization algorithm to collaboratively train model parameters between the server and clients, which can effectively prevent real-valued gradient attacks from malicious parties. Through extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, we show that our LightFR model outperforms several state-of-the-art FRS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy, inference efficiency, and data privacy.

AB Federated learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively train machine learning models, with model communication replacing direct data uploading. While over-the-air model aggregation improves communication efficiency, uploading models to an edge server over wireless networks can pose privacy risks. Differential privacy (DP) is a widely used quantitative technique to measure statistical data privacy in FL. Previous research has focused on over-the-air FL with a single-antenna server, leveraging communication noise to enhance user-level DP. This approach achieves the so-called "free DP" by controlling transmit power rather than introducing additional DP-preserving mechanisms at devices, such as adding artificial noise. In this paper, we study differentially private over-the-air FL over a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channel. We show that FL model communication with a multiple-antenna server amplifies privacy leakage when the multiple-antenna server employs separate receive combining for model aggregation and information inference. Consequently, relying solely on communication noise, as done in the multiple-input single-output system, cannot meet high privacy requirements, and a device-side privacy-preserving mechanism is necessary for optimal DP design. We analyze the learning convergence and privacy loss of the studied FL system and propose a transceiver design algorithm based on alternating optimization. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a better privacy-learning trade-off compared to prior work.

AB In recent years, deep neural networks have been widely applied in remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, and good prognostic performance has been achieved. However, existing centralized learning methods often ignore data privacy, modeling efficiency, and common feature of learning tasks. This paper presents a new RUL pre-diction method using global health degradation representation (GHDR) in federated learning (FL) framework named GHDR-FL, which aims to extract GHDR from distributed datasets and build personalized models for multiple clients. Specifically, GHDR is an aggregation of shallow features learned by the FL server and clients jointly. The head of each model is the unique superstructure, which is adopted to extract high-level features from the GHDR and local data on the client side. With the GHDR and unique superstructures, RUL prediction models customized for different operating conditions and fault modes can be built simultaneously in the FL. A degra-dation dataset of turbofan engines is used to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the GHDR-FL has high accuracy than the centralized learning methods, and the ready-made GHDR has strong versatility.

AB This paper addresses the escalating demand for aquaculture products by proposing an edge-cloud solution for precision aquaculture. Despite technological advancements, challenges persist in the aquaculture industry, including labor shortages and inaccurate data analysis. The project focuses on water quality monitoring, employing IoT sensors in an edge computing environment to collect real-time parameters and using a camera module to analyze the growth of prawns. Local processing minimizes bandwidth requirements and latency, with data transmitted to the cloud for analysis and graphical visualization. In this paper, we present a unique edge-cloud architecture for precision aquaculture tailored to small-scale and resource-constrained farmers. The paper introduces a federated learning framework, utilizing a distributed computing architecture, where the edge environment acts as the client node, training a local machine learning model. The cloud server aggregates model weights from diverse clients, creating a robust global model without compromising individual data privacy. This comprehensive solution aims to improve aquaculture efficiency, address production challenges, reduce high consumption of network bandwidth, and ensure sustainable practices.

TI Enabling SQL-based Training Data Debugging for Federated Learning
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT

DT Article
ID PRIVACY
AB How can we debug a logistic regression model in a federated learning setting when seeing the model behave unexpectedly (e.g., the model rejects all high-income customers' loan applications)? The SQL-based training data debugging framework has proved effective to fix this kind of issue in a non-federated learning setting. Given an unexpected query result over model predictions, this framework automatically removes the label errors from training data such that the unexpected behavior disappears in the retrained model. In this paper, we enable this powerful framework for federated learning. The key challenge is how to develop a security protocol for federated debugging which is proved to be secure, efficient, and accurate. Achieving this goal requires us to investigate how to seamlessly integrate the techniques from multiple fields (Databases, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity). We first propose FEDRAIN, which extends RAIN, the state-of-the-art SQL-based training data debugging framework, to our federated learning setting. We address several technical challenges to make FEDRAIN work and analyze its security guarantee and time complexity. The analysis results show that FEDRAIN falls short in terms of both efficiency and security. To overcome these limitations, we redesign our security protocol and propose FROG, a novel SQL-based training data debugging framework tailored for federated learning. Our theoretical analysis shows that FROG is more secure, more accurate, and more efficient than Fr:DRAIN. We conduct extensive experiments using several real-world datasets and a case study. The experimental results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and validate the effectiveness of FROG in practice.

AB Zhang et al. (2023) recently proposed a secure federated learning (FL) scheme named LSFL to guarantee Byzantine robustness while protecting privacy in FL. In this work, we show that LSFL breaches privacy it claimed. Specifically, we demonstrate that the secure Byzantine robustness procedure of LSFL exposes significant information of all participant models and data to a semi-honest server, thereby damaging privacy. Then, we analyze the reason for this security issue and give a suggestion to prevent privacy breaches in LSFL.

AB Water quality monitoring plays a critical role in safeguarding public health and environmental sustainability. Traditional centralized approaches to water quality analysis face challenges related to data privacy, scalability, and resource constraints. In this study, we propose a decentralized approach to water quality classification using federated learning (FL) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). By leveraging FL techniques, our framework allows for collaborative model training across geographically distributed data sources, such as water treatment plants and environmental monitoring stations, without the need to share sensitive data. We employ RNNs, specifically long short-term memory networks, to capture temporal dependencies in time-series water quality data. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately classifying water quality parameters, including pH levels, dissolved oxygen concentrations, and pollutant levels, while preserving data privacy and security. Our findings highlight the potential of FL with RNNs as a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for decentralized water quality monitoring and classification.

AB Federated learning (FL) over mobile devices has fostered numerous intriguing applications/services, many of which are delay-sensitive. In this paper, we propose a service delay efficient FL (SDEFL) scheme over mobile devices. Unlike traditional communication efficient FL, which regards wireless communications as the bottleneck, we find that under many situations, the local computing delay is comparable to the communication delay during the FL training process, given the development of high-speed wireless transmission techniques. Thus, the service delay in FL should be computing delay + communication delay over training rounds. To minimize the service delay of FL, simply reducing local computing/communication delay independently is not enough. The delay trade-off between local computing and wireless communications must be considered. Besides, we empirically study the impacts of local computing control and compression strategies (i.e., the number of local updates, weight quantization, and gradient quantization) on computing, communication and service delays. Based on those trade-off observation and empirical studies, we develop an optimization scheme to minimize the service delay of FL over heterogeneous devices. We establish testbeds and conduct extensive emulations/experiments to verify our theoretical analysis. The results show that SDEFL reduces notable service delay with a small accuracy drop compared to peer designs.

AB Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning approach that enables multiple users to share their local models for the aggregation of a global model, protecting data privacy by avoiding the sharing of raw data. However, frequent parameter sharing between users and the aggregator can incur high risk of membership privacy leakage. In this paper, we propose LiPFed, a computationally lightweight privacy preserving FL scheme using secure decentralized aggregation for edge networks. Under this scheme, we ensure privacy preservation on the aggregation side, and promote lightweight computation on the user side. By incorporating blockchain and additive secret sharing algorithm, we effectively protect the membership privacy of both local models and global models. Furthermore, the secure decentralized aggregation mechanism safeguards against potential compromises of the aggregator. Meanwhile, smart contract is introduced to identify malicious models uploaded by edge nodes and return trustworthy global models to users. Rigorous security analysis shows the effectiveness of this scheme in privacy preservation. Extensive experiments verify that LiPFed outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes in terms of training efficiency, model accuracy, and privacy preservation.

ID ANALOG FUNCTION COMPUTATION; DESIGN
AB In this study, we propose a digital over-the-air computation (OAC) scheme for achieving continuous-valued (analog) aggregation for federated edge learning (FEEL). We show that the average of a set of real-valued parameters can be calculated approximately by using the average of the corresponding numerals, where the numerals are obtained based on a balanced number system. By exploiting this key property, the proposed scheme encodes the local stochastic gradients into a set of numerals. Next, it determines the positions of the activated orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers by using the values of the numerals. To eliminate the need for precise sample-level time synchronization, channel estimation overhead, and channel inversion, the proposed scheme also uses a non-coherent receiver at the edge server (ES) and does not utilize a pre-equalization at the edge devices (EDs). We theoretically analyze the MSE performance of the proposed scheme and the convergence rate for a non-convex loss function. To improve the test accuracy of FEEL with the proposed scheme, we introduce the concept of adaptive absolute maximum (AAM). Our numerical results show that when the proposed scheme is used with AAM for FEEL, the test accuracy can reach up to 98% for heterogeneous data distribution.

AB Wearable devices and smartphones that are used to monitor the activity and the state of the driver collect a lot of sensitive data such as audio, video, location and even health data. The analysis and processing of such data require observing the strict legal requirements for personal data security and privacy. The federated learning (FL) computation paradigm has been proposed as a privacy-preserving computational model that allows securing the privacy of the data owner. However, it still has no formal proof of privacy guarantees, and recent research showed that the attacks targeted both the model integrity and privacy of the data owners could be performed at all stages of the FL process. This paper focuses on the analysis of the privacy-preserving techniques adopted for FL and presents a comparative review and analysis of their implementations in the open-source FL frameworks. The authors evaluated their impact on the overall training process in terms of global model accuracy, training time and network traffic generated during the training process in order to assess their applicability to driver's state and behaviour monitoring. As the usage scenario, the authors considered the case of the driver's activity monitoring using the data from smartphone sensors. The experiments showed that the current implementation of the privacy-preserving techniques in open-source FL frameworks limits the practical application of FL to cross-silo settings.

AB Privacy preservation is a critical concern in Federated Learning (FL). However, traditional Local Differential Privacy (LDP) methods face challenges in balancing FL model accuracy with noise strength. To address this, we propose a novel adaptive differential privacy method with feedback regulation, FedFR-ADP. First, we employ Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to measure the data heterogeneity of each client and adaptively apply Gaussian noise based on the degree of heterogeneity, making the noise addition more targeted and effective. Second, we introduce a feedback regulation mechanism to dynamically tune the privacy budget according to the global model's error feedback, further enhancing model performance. Finally, we validate our approach through experiments on two commonly used image classification datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that FedFR-ADP outperforms three benchmark algorithms, including DP-FedAvg, in terms of model training accuracy and Mean Squared Error (MSE) under varying degrees of heterogeneity. Compared to these benchmarks, FedFR-ADP achieves at least a 3.05% and 1.76% improvement in training accuracy across both datasets, with significantly reduced MSE fluctuations. This not only boosts model accuracy but also provides more stable noise control.

AB Federated learning (FL) allows the collaborative training of machine learning (ML) models between an aggregation server and different clients without sharing their private data. However, the FL archetype is mostly vulnerable to malicious model updates from various clients because of the privacy feature that makes the server see clients as a black box. When selecting clients, the server has no control on their contributions during training. This opacity of the server toward clients' data associated with the huge amount of heterogeneous data brings a security risk and poses a deterioration of the model performance in FL. The impact of client selection and data heterogeneity on FL robustness has been overlooked. In this article, we develop an incentive design for heterogeneous client selection (IHCS) to improve the performance while reducing the security risks in FL. The IHCS approach applies a smarter client selection method using cooperative game theory and dynamic clustering of clients based on their heterogeneity level to overcome the challenges of lacking access to clients' data, unbalanced data, and the lack of applicable data contribution from clients in FL. To do so, we attribute a recognition value to each client using the Shapley value. This recognition index is then used to aggregate the probability of participation level. We also implement, within the IHCS, a heterogeneity-based clustering (HIC) method that helps inhibit the negative influence of data heterogeneity and increase client contributions. Through extensive experiments with empirical results, the proposed approach outperforms the representative works on robustness of FL.

AB Recommendations based on prediction of user preferences from partial information are widely used in various applications. However, recommendations using smart devices have some challenges related to limited data device resources, data sparsity, and data privacy. Since there are many multidimensional data in smart devices, recommendations may collect a large amount of user private data. In this article, we study privacy-preserving recommendations with high-dimensional tensor data in smart devices. First, we propose a federated tensor completion scheme to infer the user's preferences and we prove that this scheme satisfies the differential privacy guarantee. Our scheme consists of a global update and a local update, which reduce information exposure and guarantee local data privacy. Second, we mathematically analyze the privacy and utility of the proposed algorithm. Third, we provide empirical evaluations on synthetic data sets and real-world data sets. Results show that our scheme has a low recovery error and provides strong privacy protection.

DE GBDT; Federated ensemble method; Similar samples; Federated learning
AB Federated learning is a hot topic in the field of multi-source data. It has the advantage that the data cannot be localized, and it has the problems that the parameters of the local model are difficult to integrate and the accuracy of the model is low. In this paper, an improved gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) federated ensemble learning method is proposed, which takes the average gradient of similar samples and its own gradient as a new gradient to improve the accuracy of the local model. Different ensemble learning methods are used to integrate the parameters of the local model, thus improving the accuracy of the updated global model. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the global model trained by the method on magic-gamma-telescope datasets and eeg-eye-state datasets is compared with that of GBDT federated ensemble method and traditional multi-source data processing technology without finding similar samples. The accuracy of the model is improved by 0.6%, 0.45% and 0.27% and 0.08% respectively, which makes it possible to improve the security of data and model while improving the accuracy of the model.

   Toxicology; Smoothing methods; Federated learning; poisoning attack;

AB In federated learning (FL), poisoning attack invades the whole system by manipulating the client data, tampering with the training target, and performing any desired behaviors. Until now, numerous poisoning attacks have been carefully studied, however they are still practically challenged in real-world scenarios from two aspects: (i) multiple malicious client selections - poisoning attacks are only successfully launched when the malicious client has been chosen in enough epochs (i.e., more than half of the epochs); (ii) long-term poisoning training - the poisoning training usually needs much more epochs than the normal training (i.e., 3 times longer than normal training), both are unavailable in real cases. To address these overlooked problems, we propose a Poisoning Enhanced attack (PoE) against FLs, which is a general poisoning reinforcement framework. It is designed to transfer partially predicted probabilities of the source class to the target one. Thus, the inter-class distance between the source class and the target class is narrowed down in feature space for easier attacks. Towards this goal, the attack client uses label smoothing to change the model prediction distribution, dragging the global model in the direction that is favorable for poisoning. Extensive experiments show that PoE can significantly enhance the attack success rate (similar to x 8.4 on average) in practical FLs with normal training epochs. It also achieves stateof-the-art adaptive attack performance against defensive FLs (i.e., robust aggregations). The code of PoE could be downloaded at https://github.com/Leon022/poisoning_enhancement.

AB The concept of Federated Learning (FL), which is vital to the development of machine learning, has emerged as a convergence of machine learning, information, and communication technology. However, general FL settings cannot meet requirements in decentralized environments, especially in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, where a fully connected central server is unavailable due to limited communication ranges. In this paper, to satisfy the requirements of security, privacy preservation, and robustness in the context of FL in P2P networks, we propose a decentralized global model training protocol, named PPT. Particularly, PPT aggregates local model update parameters in a single-hop manner and uses the symmetric cryptosystem to ensure secure communications between network nodes where an enhanced Eschenauer-Gligor (E-G) scheme is proposed for secure key distribution. Further, PPT generates random noise for privacy preservation without reducing the model accuracy since the noise is eliminated ulti-mately. PPT also adopts game theory to resist collusion attacks. In addition, PPT has elaborate designs in terms of communication efficiency and dropout-robustness. Through extensive analysis, we demon-strate that PPT can resist various security threats and preserve user privacy. Ingenious experiments on Trec05, Trec06p, Trec07, and SMS Spam Collection v.1 confirm the 20 x and 12 x improvement of compu-tation efficiency that PPT achieves compared to Google's Secure Aggregation and Local Differential Privacy (LDP)-based FL methods. More importantly, the global model trained by PPT is better than that trained by LDP-based FL methods in terms of prediction performance (about 14% and 1% improvement in conver-gence rate and accuracy).(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper introduces a cutting-edge data architecture designed for a smart advertising context, prioritizing efficient data flow and performance, robust security, while guaranteeing data privacy and integrity. At the core of this study lies the application of federated learning (FL) as the primary methodology, which emphasizes the authenticity and privacy of data while promptly discarding irrelevant or fraudulent information. Our innovative data model employs a semi-random role assignment strategy based on a variety of criteria to efficiently collect and amalgamate data. The architecture is composed of model nodes, data nodes, and validator nodes, where the role of each node is determined by factors such as computational capability, interconnection quality, and historical performance records. A key feature of our proposed system is the selective engagement of a subset of nodes for modeling and validation, optimizing resource use and minimizing data loss. The AROUND social network platform serves as a real-world case study, illustrating the efficacy of our data architecture in a practical setting. Both simulated and real implementations of our architecture showcase its potential to dramatically curtail network traffic and average CPU usage, while preserving the accuracy of the FL model. Remarkably, the system is capable of achieving over a 50% reduction in both network traffic and average CPU usage even when the user count escalates by twenty-fold. The click rate, user engagement, and other parameters have also been evaluated, proving that the proposed architecture's advantages do not affect the smart advertising accuracy. These findings highlight the proposed architecture's capacity to scale efficiently and maintain high performance in smart advertising environments, making it a valuable contribution to the evolving landscape of digital marketing and FL.

AB COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the globe and become a deadly pandemic. Recently, many artificial intelligence-based approaches have been used for COVID-19 detection, but they often require public data sharing with cloud data centers and thus, remain privacy concerns. This article proposes a new federated learning (FL) scheme, called FedGAN, to generate realistic COVID-19 images for facilitating privacy-enhanced COVID-19 detection with generative adversarial networks (GANs) in edge cloud computing. Particularly, we first propose a GAN where a discriminator and a generator based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at each edge-based medical institution alternatively are trained to mimic the real COVID-19 data distribution. Then, we propose a new FL solution, which allows local GANs to collaborate and exchange learned parameters with a cloud server, aiming to enrich the global GAN model for generating realistic COVID-19 images without the need for sharing actual data. To enhance the privacy in federated COVID-19 data analytics, we integrate a differential privacy solution at each hospital institution. Moreover, we propose a new blockchain-based FedGAN framework for secure COVID-19 data analytics by decentralizing the FL process with a new mining solution for low running latency. Simulations results demonstrate the superiority of our approach for COVID-19 detection over the state-of-the-art schemes.

AB Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging decentralized learning framework through which multiple clients can collaboratively train a learning model. However, a major obstacle that impedes the wide deployment of FL lies in massive communication traffic. To train high dimensional machine learning models (such as CNN models), heavy communication traffic can be incurred by exchanging model updates via the Internet between clients and the parameter server (PS), implying that the network resource can be easily exhausted. Compressing model updates is an effective way to reduce the traffic amount. However, a flexible unbiased compression algorithm applicable for both uplink and downlink compression in FL is still absent from existing works. In this work, we devise the Model Update Compression by Soft Clustering (MUCSC) algorithm to compress model updates transmitted between clients and the PS. In MUCSC, it is only necessary to transmit cluster centroids and the cluster ID of each model update. Moreover, we prove that: 1) The compressed model updates are unbiased estimation of their original values so that the convergence rate by transmitting compressed model updates is unchanged; 2) MUCSC can guarantee that the influence of the compression error on the model accuracy is minimized. Then, we further propose the boosted MUCSC (B-MUCSC) algorithm, a biased compression algorithm that can achieve an extremely high compression rate by grouping insignificant model updates into a super cluster. B-MUCSC is suitable for scenarios with very scarce network resource. Ultimately, we conduct extensive experiments with the CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets to demonstrate that our algorithms can not only substantially reduce the volume of communication traffic in FL, but also improve the training efficiency in practical networks.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be utilized as airborne base stations to deliver wireless communication and federated learning (FL) training services for ground vehicles. However, most existing studies assume that vehicles (clients) and UAVs (model owners) offer services voluntarily. In reality, participants (FL clients and model owners) are selfish and will not engage in training without compensation. Meanwhile, due to the heterogeneity of participants and the presence of free-riders and Byzantine behaviors, the quality of vehicles' model updates can vary significantly. To incentivize participants to engage in model training and ensure reliable outcomes, this paper designs a reliable incentive mechanism (FedBeam) based on game theory. Specifically, we model the cooperation problem between model owners and clients as a two-layer Stackelberg game and prove the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE). For the cooperation among model owners, we formulate the problem as a coalition game and based on this, analyze and design a coalition formation algorithm to derive the Pareto optimal social utility. Additionally, to achieve reliable FL model updates, we design a weighted-beta (Wbeta) reputation update mechanism to incentivize FL clients to provide high-quality model updates. The experimental results show that compared to the baselines, the proposed incentive mechanism improves social welfare by 17.6% and test accuracy by 5.5% on simulated and real datasets, respectively.

AB Background and introductionFederated learning (FL) has been widely employed for medical image analysis to facilitate multi-client collaborative learning without sharing raw data. Despite great success, FL's applications remain suboptimal in neuroimage analysis tasks such as lesion segmentation in multiple sclerosis (MS), due to variance in lesion characteristics imparted by different scanners and acquisition parameters. MethodsIn this work, we propose the first FL MS lesion segmentation framework via two effective re-weighting mechanisms. Specifically, a learnable weight is assigned to each local node during the aggregation process, based on its segmentation performance. In addition, the segmentation loss function in each client is also re-weighted according to the lesion volume for the data during training. ResultsThe proposed method has been validated on two FL MS segmentation scenarios using public and clinical datasets. Specifically, the case-wise and voxel-wise Dice score of the proposed method under the first public dataset is 65.20 and 74.30, respectively. On the second in-house dataset, the case-wise and voxel-wise Dice score is 53.66, and 62.31, respectively. Discussions and conclusionsThe Comparison experiments on two FL MS segmentation scenarios using public and clinical datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method by significantly outperforming other FL methods. Furthermore, the segmentation performance of FL incorporating our proposed aggregation mechanism can achieve comparable performance to that from centralized training with all the raw data.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Federated learning (FL) algorithms usually sample a fraction of clients in each round (partial participation) when the number of participants is large and the server's communication bandwidth is limited. Recent works on the convergence analysis of FL have focused on unbiased client sampling, e.g., sampling uniformly at random, which suffers from slow wall-clock time for convergence due to high degrees of system heterogeneity (e.g., diverse computation and communication capacities) and statistical heterogeneity (e.g., unbalanced and non-i.i.d. data). This article aims to design an adaptive client sampling algorithm for FL over wireless networks that tackles both system and statistical heterogeneity to minimize the wall-clock convergence time. We obtain a new tractable convergence bound for FL algorithms with arbitrary client sampling probability. Based on the bound, we analytically establish the relationship between the total learning time and sampling probability with an adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme, which results in a non-convex optimization problem. We design an efficient algorithm for learning the unknown parameters in the convergence bound and develop a low-complexity algorithm to approximately solve the non-convex problem. Our solution reveals the impact of system and statistical heterogeneity parameters on the optimal client sampling design. Moreover, our solution shows that as the number of sampled clients increases, the total convergence time first decreases and then increases because a larger sampling number reduces the number of rounds for convergence but results in a longer expected time per-round due to limited wireless bandwidth. Experimental results from both hardware prototype and simulation demonstrate that our proposed sampling scheme significantly reduces the convergence time compared to several baseline sampling schemes. Notably, for EMNIST dataset, our scheme in hardware prototype spends 71% less time than the baseline uniform sampling for reaching the same target loss.

AB Empowered by 5G, it has been extensively explored by existing works on the deployment of differentially private federated learning (DPFL) in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Through federated learning, decentralized IIoT devices can collaboratively train a machine learning model by merely exchanging model gradients with a parameter server (PS) for multiple global iterations. Differentially private (DP) mechanisms will be incorporated by IIoT devices (also called clients) to prevent the leakage of privacy due to the exposure of gradients because original gradients will be distorted DP noises. Yet, learning with distorted gradients can seriously deteriorate model accuracy, making DPFL unusable in reality. To address this problem, we propose a novel DPFL with sparse responses (DPFL-SR) algorithm, which applies the sparse vector technique to reduce the privacy budget consumption in each global iteration. Specifically, DPFL-SR evaluates the value of each gradient, and only distorts and uploads significant gradients to the PS because significant gradients are more essential for model training. Since insignificant gradients are not disclosed, the reserved privacy budget can be used to return significant gradients for more iterations so that DPFL-SR can achieve higher model accuracy without lowering the privacy protection level. Extensive experiments are conducted with the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets to demonstrate the practicability and superiority of DPFL-SR in IIoT systems.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving deep learning using data distributed on Internet of Things devices. Traditional model sharing-based methods, e.g., federated averaging (FedAvg), suffer from high communication overhead and difficulty in accommodating heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation (FD) is a recently proposed alternative to enable communication-efficient and robust FL, as well as heterogeneous client models. However, there is a lack of theoretical understanding of FD-based methods, and their design guidelines remain elusive. This article presents a generic meta-algorithm for FD, generalizing most existing FD training algorithms. By studying a linear classification problem, we show that, with sufficient distillation samples, the training performance of the meta-algorithm is the same as the vanilla FedAvg. To guide the algorithm design and improve communication efficiency, we further investigate the binary classification problem with a Gaussian mixture model, which shows that more distillation data and sampling data with higher confidence improve the training performance. Furthermore, we propose an effective distillation data sampling technique to improve the performance of the FD-meta algorithm, which also reduces communication overhead. Simulations on the benchmark data sets validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our proposed algorithm effectively reduces the communication overhead while achieving a satisfactory performance.

AB Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as an approach to provide a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient Machine Learning (ML) framework in mobile-edge environments which are likely to be resource-constrained and heterogeneous. Therefore, the required precision level and performance from each of the devices may vary depending upon the circumstances, giving rise to designs containing mixed-precision and quantized models. Among the various quantization schemes, binary and ternary representations are significant since they enable arrangements that can strike effective balances between performance and precision. In this paper, we propose RLFL, a hybrid ternary/full-precision FL system along with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) aggregation method with the goal of improved performance comparing to a homogeneous ternary environment. This system consists a mix of clients with full-precision and resource-constrained clients with ternary ML models. However, aggregating models with ternary and full-precision weights using traditional aggregation approaches present a challenge due to the disparity in weight magnitudes. In order to obtain an improved accuracy, we use a deep RL model to explore and optimize the amount of contribution assigned to each client's model for aggregation in each iteration. We evaluate and compare accuracy and communication overhead of the proposed approach against the prior work for the classification of MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. Evaluation results show that the proposed RLFL system, along with its aggregation technique, outperforms the existing FL approaches in accuracy ranging from 5% to 19% while imposing negligible computation overhead.

AB In this article, we propose a novel framework to address straggling and privacy issues for federated learning (FL)-based mobile application services, taking into account limited computing/communications resources at mobile users (MUs)/mobile application provider (MAP), privacy cost, the rationality and incentive competition among MUs in contributing data to the MAP. Particularly, the MAP first determines a set of the best MUs for the FL process based on the MUs' provided information/features. To mitigate straggling problems with privacy-awareness, each selected MU can then encrypt part of local data and upload the encrypted data to the MAP for an encrypted training process, in addition to the local training process. For that, each selected MU can propose a contract to the MAP according to its expected trainable local data and privacy-protected encrypted data. To find the optimal contracts that can maximize utilities of the MAP and all the participating MUs while maintaining high learning quality of the whole system, we first develop a multi-principal one-agent contract-based problem leveraging FL-based multiple utility functions. These utility functions account for the MUs' privacy cost, the MAP's limited computing resources, and asymmetric information between the MAP and MUs. Then, we transform the problem into an equivalent low-complexity problem and develop a light-weight iterative algorithm to effectively find the optimal solutions. Experiments with a real-world dataset show that our framework can speed up training time up to 49% and improve prediction accuracy up to 4.6 times while enhancing the network's social welfare, i.e., total utility of all participating entities, up to 114% under the privacy cost consideration compared with those of baseline methods.

AB Federated learning (FL) is an effective approach to train models collaboratively among distributed edge nodes (i.e., workers) while facing three crucial challenges, edge heterogeneity, resource constraint, and Non-IID data. Under the parameter server (PS) architecture, a single parameter server may become the system bottleneck and cannot well deal with the edge heterogeneity, while the peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture causes significant communication consumption to achieve satisfactory training performance. To this end, hierarchical aggregation (HA) architecture is proposed to cluster workers to tackle the edge heterogeneity and reduce communication consumption for FL. However, the existing researches on HA architecture cannot provide a unified clustering approach for various inter-cluster aggregation patterns (e.g., centralized or decentralized structure, synchronous or asynchronous mode). In this paper, we explore the quantitative relationship between the convergence bounds of different inter-cluster patterns and several factors, e.g., data distribution, frequency of clusters participating in inter-cluster aggregation (for asynchronous modes), and inter-cluster topology (for decentralized structures). Based on the convergence bounds, we design a unified clustering algorithm FedUC to organize workers for different patterns. Experimental results on classical models and datasets show that FedUC can greatly accelerate the model training of different patterns by 1.79-7.39x compared with the state-of-the-art clustering methods.

AB The sixth-generation (6G) wireless network is conceptualized to provide ubiquitous and reliable network access through effective inter-networking among space, air, and terrestrial networks, while posing considerable pressure on dynamic network orchestration. Digital twin (DT) provides an alternative approach to proactively make real-time resource allocation by mapping and learning the complex network topology. However, the dual challenges of limited energy capacity and insufficient computing power of unmanned aerial vehicles make it difficult to establish digital twin on aerial networks. In light of this, in this paper, we propose a lightweight DT empowered air-ground network architecture, where the DT modelling task is distributed to diverse ground devices based on federated learning. To improve the efficiency of DT modelling, we design a distributed incentive mechanism that incentivizes high-performance ground devices to take part in federated learning. Considering the computing burden and possible private disclosure caused by the incentive, we further solve the incentive scheme with a new distributed algorithm. The optimal solution, such as the local training rounds and required accuracy of terminal devices, could be calculated in parallel on ground devices. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight DT scheme in terms of energy consumption and model accuracy.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves users' data privacy while leveraging the entire dataset of all participants. In FL, multiple models are trained independently on the clients and aggregated centrally to update a global model in an iterative process. Although this approach is excellent at preserving privacy, FL still suffers from quality issues such as attacks or byzantine faults. Recent attempts have been made to address such quality challenges on the robust aggregation techniques for FL. However, the effectiveness of state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust FL techniques is still unclear and lacks a comprehensive study. Therefore, to better understand the current quality status and challenges of these SOTA FL techniques in the presence of attacks and faults, we perform a large-scale empirical study to investigate the SOTA FL's quality from multiple angles of attacks, simulated faults (via mutation operators), and aggregation (defense) methods. In particular, we study FL's performance on the image classification tasks and use Deep Neural Networks as our model type. Furthermore, we perform our study on two generic image datasets and one real-world federated medical image dataset. We also systematically investigate the effect of the proportion of affected clients and the dataset distribution factors on the robustness of FL. After a large-scale analysis with 496 configurations, we find that most mutators on each user have a negligible effect on the final model in the generic datasets, and only one of them is effective in the medical dataset. Furthermore, we show that model poisoning attacks are more effective than data poisoning attacks. Moreover, choosing the most robust FL aggregator depends on the attacks and datasets. Finally, we illustrate that a simple ensemble of aggregators achieves a more robust solution than any single aggregator and is the best choice in 75% of the cases.

AB This article presents the first orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing(OFDM)-based digital over-the-air computation (AirComp) system for wireless federated edge learning, where multiple edge devices transmit model data simultaneously using non-orthogonal OFDM subcarriers, and the edge server aggregates data directly from the superimposed signal. Existing analog AirComp systems often assume perfect phase alignment via channel precoding and utilize uncoded analog transmission for model aggregation. In contrast, our digital AirComp system leverages digital modulation and channel codes to overcome phase asynchrony, thereby achieving accurate model aggregation for phase-asynchronous multi-user OFDM systems. To realize a digital AirComp system, we develop a medium access control (MAC) protocol that allows simultaneous transmissions from different users using non-orthogonal OFDM subcarriers, and put forth joint channel decoding and aggregation decoders tailored for convolutional and LDPC codes. To verify the proposed system design, we build a digital AirComp prototype on the USRP software-defined radio platform, and demonstrate a real-time LDPC-coded AirComp system with up to four users. Trace-driven simulation results on test accuracy versus SNR show that: 1) analog AirComp is sensitive to phase asynchrony in practical multi-user OFDM systems, and the test accuracy performance fails to improve even at high SNRs; 2) our digital AirComp system outperforms two analog AirComp systems at all SNRs, and approaches the optimal performance when SNR >= 6 dB for two-user LDPC-coded AirComp, demonstrating the advantage of digital AirComp in phase-asynchronous multi-user OFDM systems.

AB The revolutionary changes in digital healthcare have emerged as a pivotal force driving transformation in the healthcare industry. The metaverse for consumer health utilizes technologies such as virtual reality, digital twins, and big data analysis to facilitate intelligent healthcare image analysis, remote medical consultations, and other services, propelling advancements in healthcare systems. The introduction of federated learning ensures the privacy of metaverse users. However, due to data heterogeneity, consumers exhibit distinct data distributions, impacting the quality of healthcare services. Furthermore, malicious users' attacks on the model lead to inadequate diagnoses. All these challenges may overwhelm traditional methods. To resolve these challenges, we propose FedKC, a personalized federated learning algorithm with robustness against model poisoning attacks in the Consumer Health Metaverse. Furthermore, new users joining the metaverse can quickly receive customized medical services through FedKC. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedKC outperforms current algorithms in thwarting harmful attacks and enhancing client personalization capabilities.

AB Most speech recognition systems utilize cloud computing for model training and updates. Speech data, being personally identifiable information (PII), encompasses personal, privacy-sensitive, and regulated content. Relying on centralized servers or third parties can threaten confidential data, resulting in privacy breaches. Therefore, privacy issues and strict regulations (e.g., EU's general data protection regulation, California's CCPA, and the Privacy Act in Australia) limit the availability of large data sets. The scarcity of data sets is particularly pronounced in less-represented languages, like Persian, adversely impacting innovation and data-driven product development. To overcome the challenges posed by the scarcity of data sets and privacy concerns, for the first time, we propose a novel federated learning (FL) solution for Persian Spoken Isolated Digit Recognition. This proposed technique bridges the gap between privacy and utility by enabling the training of an algorithm using decentralized data sets stored on edge devices or servers, without the need for data exchange. Nonindependent and identically distributed data (non-IID), such as unique speaker accents, poses a challenge in speech recognition, especially in an FL setup. Regrettably, this challenge has largely been overlooked in existing techniques and methodologies. To address this, we present an innovative personalized clustered FL (PCFL) approach that successfully exploits similarities among the private data distributions and captures distinctive characteristics inherent in each client's data in order to train models. The experimental results show that while the proposed solution significantly addresses privacy concerns, it has a negligible performance loss compared to centralized model training techniques.

   learning; domain adaptation; communicational efficient
AB The emerging paradigm of Federated Learning enables mobile users to collaboratively train a model without disclosing their privacy-sensitive data. Nevertheless, data collected from different mobile users may not be independent and identically distributed. Thus directly applying the trained model to a new mobile user usually leads to performance degradation due to the so-called domain shift. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation is an effective technique to mitigate domain shift and transfer knowledge from labeled source domains to the unlabeled target domain. In this article, we design a Federated Domain Adaptation framework that extends Domain Adaptation with the constraints of Federated Learning to train a model for the target domain and preserve the data privacy of all the source and target domains. As mobile devices usually have limited computation and communication capabilities, we design a set of optimization methods that significantly enhance our framework's computation and communication efficiency, making it more friendly to resource-constrained edge devices. Evaluation results on three datasets show that our framework has comparable performance with the standard centralized training approach, and the optimization methods can reduce the computation and communication overheads by up to two orders of magnitude.

AB Federated learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training in the autonomous Internet of Things (IoT) system while preserving the privacy of local data on IoT clients. Nonetheless, the inherent non-IID characteristic of local data leads to poor convergence of a global model. Moreover, the global model fails to satisfy the personalized task demands of all clients. To address the above issues, this article studies client grouping and local model aggregation in FL from two perspectives: 1) measure of client data distribution and 2) distribution similarity among clients. To this end, a novel confidence-based similarity-aware personalized FL algorithm (FedCS) for personalized autonomous IoT is proposed by developing three key innovations, namely, a public average confidence (PAC) measure, a client grouping strategy with dynamic sampling (CGDS), and a sequential aggregated weight (SAW) strategy. Specifically, the PAC measure utilizes a public data set on the server side to estimate the client's data distribution, which promotes a fair estimate of distribution similarity among clients while minimizing privacy risks. The CGDS strategy focuses on distribution similarity among clients and approximates the client grouping problem as an auxiliary task selection problem in multitask learning. This strategy assigns a client into multiple groups and enables the valuable information from each client to circulate among multiple groups. The SAW strategy further incentivizes more similar clients within a group to share greater knowledge and generates an adaptive aggregated weight for each client within a group. A thorough experiment on CIFAR10 and two healthcare benchmarks shows that FedCS achieves a superior performance.

ID ALLOCATION
AB Federated learning (FL) leverages the private data and computing power of multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model. Many existing FL algorithms over wireless networks adopting synchronous model aggregation suffer from the straggler issue, due to the heterogeneity of local computing power and channel conditions. To address this issue, we in this paper advocate an asynchronous FL framework with adaptive client selection for training latency minimization, taking into account the client availability and long-term fairness. We consider a practical scenario, where the channel conditions and the locally available computing power are not known in prior. This makes the client selection problem challenging, as the training latency consists of the uplink/downlink transmission time and the local training time. To this end, we tackle the asynchronous client selection problem in an online manner by converting the latency minimization problem into a multi-armed bandit problem, and leverage the upper confidence bound policy and virtual queue technique in Lyapunov optimization to solve the problem. We theoretically show that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret performance, ensures long-term fairness, and guarantees training convergence. Results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the training time by up to 50% when compared to the baseline algorithms.

ID FRAMEWORK; NETWORKS
AB Federated learning (FL) is an efficient decentralized machine learning methodology for processing nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data due to geographical and temporal distribution differences. Non-IID data generally indicates substantial disparities in data distribution and features among clients. This assumption is completely different from the conventional assumption of independent and identically distributed (IID) data in which all clients' data originates from the same distribution. There are many factors that affect the features of non-IID data, such as user preferences, data collection methods, and client characteristics. The factors of data distribution, category proportions, and feature representation also affect the statistical properties of non-IID data. This article conducts an in-depth exploration of FL with the consideration of diverse features and statistical properties of non-IID data. Specifically, we first discuss the impact of non-IID data on communication efficiency, model convergence, and FL accuracy. The presence of non-IID data leads to increased communication overhead, imbalanced class distribution, and uneven local model updates. All of these affect FL convergence and performance. Then, we present the latest advanced techniques, such as data partitioning/sharing, client selection, differential privacy, and secure aggregation, which are used to address the challenges posed by non-IID data in terms of communication efficiency and privacy protection. Furthermore, we show the emerging applications and use cases of FL with non-IID data in various domains, such as healthcare, Internet of Things, and edge computing. Overall, this survey provides a comprehensive understanding of FL with non-IID data, including the challenges, advancements, and practical applications in different areas.

TI Efficient Federated Matrix Factorization Against Inference Attacks

ID PRIVACY; RECOMMENDATION
AB Recommender systems typically require the revelation of users' ratings to the recommender server, which will subsequently use these ratings to provide personalized services. However, such revelations make users vulnerable to a broader set of inference attacks, allowing the recommender server to learn users' private attributes, e.g., age and gender. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient federated matrix factorization method that protects users against inference attacks. The key idea is that we obfuscate one user's rating to another such that the private attribute leakage is minimized under the given distortion budget, which bounds the recommending loss and overhead of system efficiency. During the obfuscation, we apply differential privacy to control the information leakage between the users. We also adopt homomorphic encryption to protect the intermediate results during training. Our framework is implemented and tested on real-world datasets. The result shows that our method can reduce up to 16.7% of inference attack accuracy compared to using no privacy protections.

ID HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTION
AB Federated Learning (FL) relies on on-device training to avoid the migration of devices' data to a centralized server to address privacy leakage. Moreover, FL is feasible for scenarios (e.g., autonomous cars) where an enormous amount of data is generated every day. Transferring only local model updates in the case of FL is highly communication-efficient compared to transferring all data in the case of centralized machine learning (ML). Although FL offers many advantages, it also has some challenges. A malicious aggregation server can infer device information via local model updates. Another downside of FL is the centralized aggregation server that can malfunction due to an attack or physical damage. To address these issues, we propose a novel Structured Transparency empowered cross-silo Federated Learning on the Blockchain (ST-BFL) framework. In ST-BFL, homomorphic encryption, FL-aggregators, FL-verifiers, and smart contract are employed, which satisfy various structured transparency components, such as input privacy, output privacy, output verification, and flow governance. We present the framework architecture, algorithms, and sequence diagram of our ST-BFL framework to show how different entities interact in ST-BFL for the FL process. We also present a simplified class diagram of ST-BFL's smart contract for an FL task. Finally, we perform a simulation to analyze our framework from the perspective of aggregation time, accuracy, and storage size. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows that ST-BFL has the same accuracy as traditional FL. However, ST-BFL provides input privacy, output privacy, input verification, output verification, and flow governance at the expense of relatively higher computation and communication costs than traditional FL.

AB COVID-19-like pandemics are a major threat to the global health system have the potential to cause high mortality across age groups. The advance of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) technologies paves the way toward developing reliable solutions to combat these pandemics. Medical images (i.e., X-rays, computed tomography (CT)) provide an efficient tool for disease detection and diagnosis. The cost, time, and efforts for acquiring and annotating, for instance, large CT datasets make it complicated to obtain large numbers of samples from a single institution. However, owing to the necessity to preserve the privacy of patient data, it is challenging to build a centralized dataset from many institutions, especially during a pandemic. Moreover, heterogeneity between institutions presents a barrier to building efficient screening solutions. Thus, this paper presents a fog-based federated generative domain adaption framework (FGDA), where fog nodes aggregate patients' data necessary to collaboratively train local deep-learning models for disease screening in medical images from different institutions. Local differential privacy is presented to protect the local gradients against attackers during the global model aggregation. In FGDA, the generative domain adaptation (DA) method is introduced to handle data discrepancies. Experimental evaluation on a case study of COVID-19 segmentation demonstrated the efficiency of FGDA over competing learning approaches with statistical significance.

AB In this article, we investigate the problem of federated learning (FL) in a communication-constrained environment of the Internet of Things (IoT), where multiple IoT clients train a global model collectively by communicating model updates with a central server instead of sending raw data sets. To ease the communication burden in IoT systems, several approaches have been proposed for the FL tasks, including sparsification methods and data quantization strategies. To overcome the shortcomings of the existing methods, we propose two new FL algorithms based on compressed sensing (CS) referred to as the CS-FL algorithm and the 1-bit CS-FL algorithm, both of which compress the upstream and downstream data while communicating between the clients and the central server. The proposed algorithms improve upon the existing algorithms by letting the clients send analog and 1-bit data, respectively, to the server after compression with a random measurement matrix. Based on that, in CS-FL and 1-bit CS-FL, the clients update the model locally utilizing the result of sparse reconstruction obtained by iterative hard thresholding (IHT) and binary IHT (BIHT), respectively. Experiments conducted on the MNIST and the Fashion-MNIST data sets reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the baseline algorithms, SignSGD with a majority vote, FL based on sparse ternary compression, and FedAvg.

AB Federal Learning (FL) is an emerging technology in the field of machine learning (ML). Compared with traditional ML, FL is an attractive method to deal with data security issues of the user-side. So that FL can realizes its full potential in terms of low latency and high energy efficiency (EE), this paper introduces a new framework: In the wireless communication network scenario, we propose an FL architecture based on Wireless Power Transfer (WPT). By combining WPT technology and FL, we can realize green wireless communication under the premise of ensuring user privacy. We formulate a joint calculation and communication optimization problem to optimize the latency of local calculation, uplink and downlink transmission without consuming user-side energy. The problem formulas listed according to the optimization problem are non-convex. They are first transformed into convex form, and then a low-complexity iterative algorithm is used to solve them optimally. Simulations show that our proposed FL method design has achieved a significant performance improvement over other benchmark tests. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Federated learning (FL), an attractive and promising distributed machine learning paradigm, has sparked extensive interest in exploiting tremendous data stored on ubiquitous mobile devices. However, conventional FL suffers severely from resource heterogeneity, as clients with weak computational and communication capabilities may be unable to complete local training using the same local training hyper-parameters. In this article, we propose Dap-FL, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-assisted adaptive FL system, in which local learning rates and local training epochs are adaptively adjusted by all resource-heterogeneous clients through locally deployed DDPG-assisted adaptive hyper-parameter selection schemes. Particularly, the rationality of the proposed hyper-parameter selection scheme is confirmed through rigorous mathematical proof. Besides, due to the thoughtlessness of security consideration of adaptive FL systems in previous studies, we introduce the Paillier cryptosystem to aggregate local models in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. Rigorous analyses show that the proposed Dap-FL system could protect clients' private local models against chosen-plaintext attacks and chosen-message attacks in a widely used honest-but-curious participants and active adversaries security model. More importantly, through ingenious and extensive experiments, the proposed Dap-FL achieves higher model prediction accuracy than two state-of-the-art RL-assisted FL methods, i.e., 6.03% higher than DDPG-based FL and 7.85% higher than DQN-based FL. In addition, experimental results also show that the proposed Dap-FL achieves higher global model prediction accuracy and faster convergence rates than conventional FL, and the comprehensiveness of the adjusted local training hyper-parameters is validated.

AB The deep fusion of human-centered Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSSs) has attracted widespread attention worldwide and big data as the blood of CPSSs could lay a solid data cornerstone for providing more proactive and accurate wisdom services. However, due to concerns about data privacy and security, traditional data centralized learning paradigm is no longer suitable. Federated Learning (FL) as an emerging distributed privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm would have great research significance and application values. Although few survey papers on FL already exist in the literature, the survey about FL from the perspective of human-centered CPSSs and tensor theory is lacking. Toward this end, we first introduce the CPSSs and deeply analyze the correlations among humans, cyber space, physical space and social space, as well as the opportunities brought by it. Afterwards, we present an overview of FL and then review extensive researches on FL in terms of resources management, communication, security and privacy protection, which provides a shortcut for readers to quickly understand and learn FL. Furthermore, the theory about tensor representation, operation and decomposition for handling massive, multi-source heterogeneous big data and corresponding applications are described. By leveraging the advantages of tensor in unified modeling, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction, a framework and three tensor-empowered solutions are provided to solve these challenges about heterogeneous resource management, communication overhead together with security and privacy. Finally, some future research directions are listed for looking forward to inspiring more readers to devote themselves to researching tensor-empowered FL for human-centered CPSSs in the future.

ID CHALLENGES
AB Neural networks often encounter various stringent resource constraints while deploying on edge devices. To tackle these problems with less human efforts, automated machine learning becomes popular in finding various neural architectures that fit diverse Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) scenarios. Recently, to prevent the leakage of private information while enable automated machine intelligence, there is an emerging trend to integrate federated learning and neural architecture search (NAS). Although promising as it may seem, the coupling of difficulties from both tenets makes the algorithm development quite challenging. In particular, how to efficiently search the optimal neural architecture directly from massive nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data among AIoT devices in a federated manner is a hard nut to crack. In this article, to tackle this challenge, by leveraging the advances in ProxylessNAS, we propose a federated direct neural architecture search (FDNAS) framework that allows for hardware-friendly NAS from non-IID data across devices. To further adapt to both various data distributions and different type of devices with heterogeneous embedded hardware platforms, inspired by meta-learning, a cluster federated direct neural architecture search (CFDNAS) framework is proposed to achieve device-aware NAS, in the sense that each device can learn a tailored deep learning model for its particular data distribution and hardware constraint. Extensive experiments on non-IID data sets have shown the state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs achieved by the proposed solution in the presence of both data and device heterogeneity.

AB Pedestrian trajectory prediction is essential for self-driving vehicles, social robots, and intelligent monitoring applications. Diverse trajectory data is critical for high-accuracy trajectory prediction. However, the trajectory data is captured in scattered scenes, which can cause the problem of data island. Furthermore, artificial aggregation of trajectory data suffers from the risk of data leakage, ignoring the rule of privacy protection. We propose a multi-scene federated trajectory prediction (Fed-TP) method to solve the above problems. As our key contribution, a destination-oriented LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)-based trajectory prediction (DO-TP) network is proposed in each scene to forecast future trajectories in an encoder-decoder manner. The independent training using trajectory data in each scene can prevent data leakage and achieves high privacy security. As another key contribution, a federated learning framework is introduced to break the scene limitation by conducting distributed collaborative training. The performance of different federated learning methods is compared on public datasets, including ETH, UCY, and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). Compared with FedAvg and FedProx, FedAtt is more suitable for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has better data privacy security than directly training on multiple scenes and superior prediction performance than training on a single scene.

AB As one of the effective ways of ocular disease recognition, early fundus screening can help patients avoid unrecoverable blindness. Although deep learning is powerful for image-based ocular disease recognition, the performance mainly benefits from a large number of labeled data. For ocular disease, data collection and annotation in a single site usually take a lot of time. If multi-site data are obtained, there are two main issues: 1) the data privacy is easy to be leaked; 2) the domain gap among sites will influence the recognition performance. Inspired by the above, first, a Gaussian randomized mechanism is adopted in local sites, which are then engaged in a global model to preserve the data privacy of local sites and models. Second, to bridge the domain gap among different sites, a two-step domain adaptation method is introduced, which consists of a domain confusion module and a multi-expert learning strategy. Based on the above, a privacy-preserving federated learning framework with domain adaptation is constructed. In the experimental part, a multi-disease early fundus screening dataset, including a detailed ablation study and four experimental settings, is used to show the stepwise performance, which verifies the efficiency of our proposed framework.

AB The vision of the upcoming 6G technologies that have fast data rate, low latency, and ultra-dense network, draws great attentions to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication for intelligent transportation systems. There is an urgent need for distributed machine learning techniques that can take advantages of massive interconnected networks with explosive amount of heterogeneous data generated at the network edge. In this study, a two-layer federated learning model is proposed to take advantages of the distributed end-edge-cloud architecture typical in 6G environment, and to achieve a more efficient and more accurate learning while ensuring data privacy protection and reducing communication overheads. A novel multi-layer heterogeneous model selection and aggregation scheme is designed as a part of the federated learning process to better utilize the local and global contexts of individual vehicles and road side units (RSUs) in 6G supported vehicular networks. This context-aware distributed learning mechanism is then developed and applied to address intelligent object detection, which is one of the most critical challenges in modern intelligent transportation systems with autonomous vehicles. Evaluation results showed that the proposed method, which demonstrates a higher learning accuracy with better precision, recall and F1 score, outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under 6G network configuration by achieving faster convergence, and scales better with larger numbers of RSUs involved in the learning process.

AB To leverage massive distributed data and computation resources in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, federated learning (FL) is considered to be a promising technique with benefits of improved data privacy and communication efficiency. Meanwhile, cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (cell-free massive MIMO) is a promising technology to enable the IoT networks to support FL. By deploying the access points (APs) closer to the IoT devices, path loss attenuation can be reduced. However, the performance of FL is still constrained by the limited power resources of IoT devices. To address this issue, we design an energy-efficient FL scheme over cell-free IoT networks by formulating an optimization problem to minimize the total energy consumption of the IoT devices participating in the FL process. To solve the intractable problem in hand, by exploiting its unique structure, we decompose it into three subproblems that facilitate the development of the proposed scheme. First, we derive the optimal central processing unit (CPU) operating frequency for IoT devices. Then, we design an optimal power allocation scheme to mitigate the straggler effect. Next, a nonlinear programming method is adopted to obtain a suboptimal solution for the reformulated problem. Finally, a three-stage algorithm is proposed for energy consumption minimization by considering these subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate the close-to-optimal performance of the proposed algorithm for energy savings compared with three baseline algorithms and the capability to support large numbers of IoT device access by mitigating the straggler effect.

AB The scarcity of medical images significantly hampers the advancement of artificial intelligence techniques in the medical field. Medical images face the issue of inferior training accuracy and efficiency in classification tasks due to insufficient labeled data and privacy preserving demands. To address these issues, we propose a new and efficient federated learning (FL) scheme based on blockchain, called FedBG, to generate realistic images to expand the dataset for medical image classification. First, we design an enhanced classification-GAN (EC-GAN) algorithm based on cross-entropy, which expands the training target of the generator from a single improvement of image fidelity to a direction related to the classification tasks. EC-GAN increases the diversity of generated images and reduces the risk of pattern collapse. Second, we improve the generator's loss function, which is guided by the cross-entropy loss term of the classifier model and the gradient information from the discriminator model, to generate medical images with enhanced category features. This design overcomes the limitation of traditional GAN that focuses only on image authenticity judgment, and achieves the dual optimization of synthetic image and classification accuracy. Finally, we propose an improved consensus mechanism based on maximum mean discrepancy and data contribution to ensure the consistency and security of data in the blockchain. The mechanism optimizes the fairness and efficiency of the model training by dynamically evaluating the contribution of each participating node, and guarantees the trust system of FL. Experiments are performed on two datasets and results demonstrate that FedBG reduces the training time by 27-38% and improves the accuracy by 0.9-2% compared to existing methods while ensuring data privacy and generating high-quality images.

AB In recent years, although traditional intelligent fault diagnosis methods have achieved satisfactory development in transfer learning tasks, the sample information that the single client can generally provide is extremely limited in real industrial scenarios. And the private data needs to be guaranteed not to leave the local storage during the application process, which leads to obstacles for fault diagnosis methods to solve cross-device and cross-scenario client transfer tasks. Therefore, a novel federated transfer learning strategy based on dual-correction training (FTSDC) is proposed, which enables fault diagnosis for multi-device tasks without target domain samples to participate in model training. The dual correction training of source client is proposed to enhance the local network's generality, which involves two links: The multiple-functions correction model hyperparameters link and the transition training correction network attention area link. Multiple sets of optimization functions are introduced into local network training to reduce the covariate drift phenomenon caused by domain discrepancies. And the local model fine-tunes the parameters of the trained network through the transition dataset to correct attention areas. Furthermore, The central server evaluates each source client model according to the contribution of the local model to the transfer strategy, and the local model parameters are cumulatively optimized by referring to the diagnosic experience of the global model. It is worth noting that the trained local model can still demonstrate commendable performance even when faced with more complex scenarios. Finally, the proposed scheme was rigorously assessed against diverse federated learning methods across various task settings during the experimental session. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in safeguarding the data privacy of each client while concurrently enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of the target task.

AB In this article, we aim to design an architecture for privacy-preserved credit data and model sharing to guarantee the secure storage and sharing of credit information in a distributed environment. The proposed architecture optimizes the data privacy by sharing the data model instead of revealing the actual data. This article also proposes an efficient credit data storage mechanism combined with a deletable Bloom filter to guarantee a uniform consensus for the training and computation process. In addition, we propose authority control contract and credit verification contract for the secure certification of credit sharing model results under federated learning. Extensive experimental results and security analysis demonstrate that our proposed credit model sharing system based on federated learning and blockchain is of high accuracy, efficiency, as well as stability. In particular, the findings of this article could alleviate the potential credit crisis under financial pressure that assist to economic recovery after the global COVID-19 pandemic. Our approach has further boosted up the demand for efficient, secure credit models for Industry 4.0.

AB This paper provides a comprehensive study of Federated Learning (FL) with an emphasis on enabling software and hardware platforms, protocols, real-life applications and use-cases. FL can be applicable to multiple domains but applying it to different industries has its own set of obstacles. FL is known as collaborative learning, where algorithm(s) get trained across multiple devices or servers with decentralized data samples without having to exchange the actual data. This approach is radically different from other more established techniques such as getting the data samples uploaded to servers or having data in some form of distributed infrastructure. FL on the other hand generates more robust models without sharing data, leading to privacy-preserved solutions with higher security and access privileges to data. This paper starts by providing an overview of FL. Then, it gives an overview of technical details that pertain to FL enabling technologies, protocols, and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols, platforms, and real-life use-cases of FL to enable data scientists to build better privacy-preserving solutions for industries in critical need of FL. We also provide an overview of key challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore both the challenges and advantages of FL and present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how different architectures and protocols that use FL can fit together to deliver desired results.

ID INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
AB GPS trajectories serve as a significant data source for travel mode identification along with the development of various GPS-enabled smart devices. However, such data directly integrate user private information, thus hindering users from sharing data with third parties. On the other hand, existing identification methods heavily depend on the respective manual travel mode annotations, whose production is economically inefficient and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a Semi-supervised Federated Learning (SSFL) framework that can accurately identify travel modes without using users' raw trajectories data or relying on notable data labels. Specifically, we propose a new identification model named convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit model in SSFL to accurately infer travel modes from GPS trajectories. Second, we design a pseudo-labeling method for the clients to set pseudo-labels on their local unlabeled dataset by using a small public dataset at the server. Furthermore, we adopt a grouping-based aggregation scheme and a data flipping augmentation scheme, which can boost the convergence and performance of the proposed framework. Comprehensive evaluations on a real-world dataset show that SSFL outperforms centralized semi-supervised baselines and is robust to the non-independent and identically distributed data commonly seen in practice.

AB Cyberbullying has emerged as a pervasive issue in the digital age, necessitating advanced techniques for effective detection and mitigation. This research explores the integration of word embeddings, emotional features, and federated learning to address the challenges of centralized data processing and user privacy concerns prevalent in previous methods. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships and contextual information, enabling a more nuanced understanding of text data, while emotional features derived from text extend the analysis to encompass the affective dimension, enhancing cyberbullying identification. Federated learning, a decentralized learning paradigm, offers a compelling solution to centralizing sensitive user data by enabling collaborative model training across distributed devices, preserving privacy while harnessing collective intelligence. In this study, we conduct an in-depth investigation into the fusion of word embeddings, emotional features, and federated learning, complemented by the utilization of BERT, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Hyperparameters and neural architecture are explored to find optimal configurations, leading to the generation of superior results. These techniques are applied in the context of cyberbullying detection, using publicly available multi-platform (social media) cyberbullying datasets. Through extensive experiments and evaluations, our proposed framework demonstrates superior performance and robustness compared to traditional methods. The results illustrate the enhanced ability to identify and combat cyberbullying incidents effectively, contributing to the creation of safer online environments. Particularly, the BERT model consistently outperforms other deep learning models (CNN, DNN, LSTM) in cyberbullying detection while preserving the privacy of local datasets for each social platform through our improved federated learning setup. We have provided Differential Privacy based security analysis for the proposed method to further strengthen the privacy and robustness of the system. By leveraging word embeddings, emotional features, and federated learning, this research opens new avenues in cyberbullying research, paving the way for proactive intervention and support mechanisms. The comprehensive approach presented herein highlights the substantial strengths and advantages of this integrated methodology, setting a foundation for future advancements in cyberbullying detection and mitigation.

AB In recent years, federated GBDTs have gradually replaced traditional GBDTs, and become the focus of academic research. They are used to solve the task of structured data mining. Aiming at the problems of information leakage, insufficient model accuracy and high communication cost in the existing schemes of horizontal federated GBDTs, this paper proposes an algorithm of gradient boosting decision trees based on horizontal federated learning, that is, secure and efficient FL for GBDTs (SeFB). The algorithm uses locality sensitive hashing (LSH) to build a tree by collecting similar information of instances without exposing the original data of participants. In the stage of updating the tree, the algorithm aggregates the local gradients of all data participants and calculates the global leaf weights, so as to improve the accuracy of the model and reduce the communication cost. Finally, the experimental analysis shows that the algorithm can protect the privacy of the original data, and the communication cost is low. At the same time, the performance of the unbalanced binary data set is evaluated. The results show that SeFB algorithm compared with the existing schemes of horizontal federated GBDTs, the accuracy is improved by 2.53% on average.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Federated learning is a distributed machine learning approach to privacy preservation and two major technical challenges prevent a wider application of federated learning. One is that federated learning raises high demands on communication resources, since a large number of model parameters must be transmitted between the server and clients. The other challenge is that training large machine learning models such as deep neural networks in federated learning requires a large amount of computational resources, which may be unrealistic for edge devices such as mobile phones. The problem becomes worse when deep neural architecture search (NAS) is to be carried out in federated learning. To address the above challenges, we propose an evolutionary approach to real-time federated NAS that not only optimizes the model performance but also reduces the local payload. During the search, a double-sampling technique is introduced, in which for each individual, only a randomly sampled submodel is transmitted to a number of randomly sampled clients for training. This way, we effectively reduce computational and communication costs required for evolutionary optimization, making the proposed framework well suitable for real-time federated NAS.

   mobile edge computing (MEC); resource orchestration; secure aggregation
ID ALLOCATION; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK
AB Federated learning (FL) provides a new paradigm for protecting data privacy by enabling model training at devices and model aggregation at servers. However, data information may be leaked to honest-but-curious aggregation servers by updated model parameters. The existing secure methods do not fully exploit the potentiality of data characteristics in enhancing security, which makes it impossible to optimize limited system resources overall to achieve secure, fair, and efficient FL systems. In this article, a DRL-based joint secure aggregation and resource orchestration scheme is proposed to guarantee security and fairness, and improve efficiency for hierarchical FL (HFL) assisted by untrusted mobile-edge computing (MEC) servers. We formulate a joint optimization problem of data size, payment, and resource orchestration, to maximize the long-term social welfare subject to secure aggregation and limited resources. Since the formulated problem is a complex mixed integer dynamic optimization problem with NP-hardness, where multiple mixed integer optimization variables are highly coupled in time-varying constraints and objective function, it is difficult to obtain its optimal solution via traditional optimization methods. Thus, we propose a hierarchical reward function-based DRL algorithm (MATD3) to guide the agents to approach the optimal policy of secure aggregation and resource orchestration. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm MATD3 can achieve superior performance over comparison algorithms and the MEC-enabled HFL framework outperforms two-layer FL frameworks.

ID PREDICTION
AB Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are increasingly significant in modern cities due to their potential to reduce air pollution. Precise and real-time estimation of energy consumption is imperative for effective itinerary planning and optimizing vehicle systems, which can reduce driving range anxiety and decrease energy costs. As public awareness of data privacy increases, adopting approaches that safeguard data privacy in the context of BEV energy consumption modeling is crucial. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for mitigating the risk of exposing sensitive information to third parties by allowing local data to remain on devices and only sharing model updates with a central server. Our work investigates the potential of using FL methods, such as federated averaging (FedAvg) and federated personalization (FedPer), to improve BEV energy consumption prediction while maintaining user privacy. We conducted experiments using data from 10 BEVs under simulated real-world driving conditions. Our results demonstrate that the FedAvg long short-term memory (LSTM) model achieved a reduction of up to 67.84% in the mean absolute error (MAE) value of the prediction results. Furthermore, we explored various real-world scenarios and discussed how FL methods can be employed in those cases. Our findings show that FL methods can effectively improve the performance of BEV energy consumption prediction while maintaining user privacy.

AB Federated learning as a Service (FLaaS) is promoted as a privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning, which is challenged by channel impairments and the scarcity of trustworthy devices in wireless networks. Assuming a trustworthy metric (TM) reflecting the reported local models accuracy, we propose a resilient, accelerated, and risk-aware edge FL (RARE-FL) that utilizes the TM scores to provide fast and trustworthy FLaaS without relying on validation datasets. The proposed RARE-FL is applied to a communication harsh 6G non-terrestrial network, where mutually interfering unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provide FLaaS to spatially distributed edge devices. Our numerical results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets affirm the efficacy of the proposed RARE-FL, showcasing its enhanced performance and reliability over existing methodologies.

AB The increasing global incidence of COVID-19 necessitates the rapid development of a reliable method for diagnosing the disease. The virus is spreading so quickly, that medical personnel are having a difficult time identifying patients who are infected with COVID-19. This is because the symptoms of other chest diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, pneumothorax, lung cancer, and consolidation lung are like COVID-19. Additionally, there is a dearth of testing kits, and it is challenging to ascertain whether the kits provide reliable results. The second problem that occurs is the transfer of data between hospitals located in different parts of the world while adhering to the stringent confidentiality standards imposed by various organizations. When it comes to training a global deep learning model, the major concerns are protecting privacy and constructing a model through collaborative efforts. In this study, we propose a collaborative federated learning (FL) system that makes use of deep learning (DL) models to filter COVID-19 from multiple chest infections (including pneumonia, tuberculosis, pneumothorax, lung cancer, and consolidation lung) using chest X-rays (CXR) obtained from a variety of medical institutions without necessitating the sharing of patient data. We investigate a variety of essential features and components of FL environments, including naturally occurring imbalanced data distributions and non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data sets, amongst other things. This research study investigates four different DL models, which include Vgg19, DenseNet169, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201. The proposed system experimentally presents that the FL framework achieves better results with these models trained by sharing data. These findings will provide medical institutions with the confidence they need to apply collaborative methods and harness private data to fast construct a credible model for identifying multiple chest diseases.

AB The cooperation between Deep Learning (DL) and edge devices has further advanced technological developments, allowing smart devices to serve as both data sources and endpoints for DL-powered applications. However, the success of DL relies on optimal Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures, and manually developing such systems requires extensive expertise and time. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged to automate the search for the best-performing neural architectures. Meanwhile, Federated Learning (FL) addresses data privacy concerns by enabling collaborative model development without exchanging the private data of clients. In a FL system, network limitations can lead to biased model training, slower convergence, and increased communication overhead. On the other hand, traditional DNN architecture design, emphasizing validation accuracy, often overlooks computational efficiency and size constraints of edge devices. This research aims to develop a comprehensive framework that effectively balances trade-offs between model performance, communication efficiency, and the incorporation of FL into an iterative NAS algorithm. This framework aims to overcome challenges by addressing the specific requirements of FL, optimizing DNNs through NAS, and ensuring computational efficiency while considering the network constraints of edge devices. To address these challenges, we introduce Network-Aware Federated Neural Architecture Search (NAFNAS), an open-source federated neural network pruning framework with network emulation support. Through comprehensive testing, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, efficiently reducing DNN size and mitigating communication challenges. Additionally, we propose Network and Distribution Aware Client Grouping (NetDAG), a novel client grouping algorithm tailored for FL with diverse DNN architectures, considerably enhancing efficiency of communication rounds and update balance.

AB This article proposes an information security vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scheduling solution, which combines federated deep learning with distributed edge computing for V2G operation. In this framework, each charging point is equipped with an intelligent computing module to conduct distributed edge scheduling for the connected electric vehicle (EV), so that not only the computation of inference process is efficient, but also the privacy-preserving of EV users is guaranteed. Besides, the desensitized V2G data of charging points are used to train the deep neural network model in each charging station. Therefore, the accurate future data acquisition problem and the uncertainty handling challenges under traditional optimization methods is avoided. At the same time, the spatial-based and time-based clustering methods are applied to improve the accuracy of prediction. Finally, through federated learning, each charging station uploads the local model to the cloud server, and a stochastic client selection pattern is designed to improve the scalability of model aggregation in the cloud server. In this way, the digital assets of each charging station are protected, and computing and communication costs are reduced. Simulation results on real datasets show that the proposed framework has superior performance in terms of training accuracy, communication burden, and computing performance, while maintaining the privacy of EV users and the digital assets of charging stations.

AB Due to the limited resources and data privacy issue, last decade witnesses the fast development of Distributed Machine Learning (DML) at network edges. Among all the existing DML paradigms, Federated Learning (FL) would be a promising one, since in FL, each client trains its local model without sharing the raw data with others. A community of clients with the same interest can join together to derive a high-performance model by periodically synchronizing the parameters of their local models under the help of a coordination server. However, FL will encounter the straggler problem at network edges, and hence the synchronization among clients becomes inefficient. It slows down the convergence speed of learning process. To alleviate the straggler problem, we propose a method named Chronos that accelerates FL with training volume tuning in this paper. More specifically, Chronos is a resource aware method that adaptively adjusts the amount of data used by each client for training (i.e., training volume) in each iteration in order to eliminate the synchronization waiting time caused by the heterogeneous and dynamical computing and communication resources. In addition, we theoretically analyze the convergence of Chronos in a non-convex setting and utilize the results for the algorithm design of Chronos in return to guarantee the convergence. Extensive experiments show that compared with the benchmark algorithms (i.e., BSP and SSP), Chronos significantly improves convergence speed by up to 6.4x.

AB To unveil the hidden value in the datasets of user equipments (UEs) while preserving user privacy, federated learning (FL) is emerging as a promising technique to train a machine learning model using the datasets of UEs locally without uploading the datasets to a central location. Customers require to train machine learning models based on different datasets of UEs, through issuing FL requests that are implemented by FL services in a mobile edge computing (MEC) network. A key challenge of enabling FL in MEC networks is how to minimize the energy consumption of implementing FL requests while guaranteeing the accuracy of machine learning models, given that the availabilities of UEs usually are uncertain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of energy minimization for FL in an MEC network with uncertain availabilities of UEs. We first consider the energy minimization problem for a single FL request in an MEC network. We then propose a novel optimization framework for the problem with a single FL request, which consists of (1) an online learning algorithm with a bounded regret for the UE selection, by considering various contexts (side information) that influence energy consumption; and (2) an approximation algorithm with an approximation ratio for the aggregator placement for a single FL request. We third deal with the problem with multiple FL requests, for which we devise an online learning algorithm with a bounded regret. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms by extensive experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform their counterparts by reducing at least 13% of the total energy consumption while achieving the same accuracy.

AB Edge computing has the capability to process data closer to its point of origin, leading to the development of critical autonomous infrastructures with frequently communicating peers. The proposed work aims to evaluate the effectiveness of security and privacy mechanisms tailored for distributed systems, particularly focusing on scenarios where the nodes are closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems. Ensuring public safety, object tracking in surveillance systems is a vital responsibility. The workflow has been specifically crafted and simulated for the purpose of weapon detection within public CCTV systems, utilizing sample edge devices. The system's primary objective is to detect any unauthorized use of weapons in public spaces while concurrently ensuring the integrity of video footage for use in criminal investigations. The outcomes of prior research on distributed machine learning (DML) techniques are compared with modified federated machine learning (FML) techniques, specifically designed for being Gossip verifiable and Quantum Safe. The conventional federated averaging algorithm is modified by incorporating the secret sharing principle, coupled with code-based McEliece cryptosystem. This adaptation is designed to fortify the system against quantum threats. The Gossip data dissemination protocol, executed via custom blockchain atop the distributed network, serves to authenticate and validate the learning model propagated among the peers in the network. It provides additional layer of integrity to the system. Potential threats to the proposed model are analyzed and the efficiency of the work is assessed using formal proofs. The outcomes of the proposed work demonstrate that the trustworthiness and consistency are meticulously preserved for both the model and data within the DML framework on the Edge computing platform.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a promising machine learning approach for Internet of Things (IoT), but it has to address network congestion problems when the population of IoT devices grows. Hierarchical FL (HFL) alleviates this issue by distributing model aggregation to multiple edge servers. Nevertheless, the challenge of communication overhead remains, especially in scenarios where all IoT devices simultaneously join the training process. For scalability, practical HFL schemes select a subset of IoT devices to participate in the training, hence the notion of device scheduling. In this setting, only selected IoT devices are scheduled to participate in the global training, with each of them being assigned to one edge server. Existing HFL assignment methods are primarily based on search mechanisms, which suffer from high latency in finding the optimal assignment. This article proposes an improved K -center algorithm for device scheduling and introduces a deep reinforcement learning-based approach for assigning IoT devices to edge servers. Experiments show that scheduling 50% of IoT devices is generally adequate for achieving convergence in HFL with much lower time delay and energy consumption. In cases where reduction in energy consumption (such as in Green artificial intelligence) and reduction of messages (to avoid burst traffic) are key objectives, scheduling 30% IoT devices allows a substantial reduction in energy and messages with similar model accuracy.

AB A key feature of federated learning (FL) is to preserve the data privacy of end users. However, there still exist potential privacy leakage in exchanging gradients under FL. As a result, recent research often explores the differential privacy (DP) approaches to add noises to the computing results to address privacy concerns with low overheads, which however degrade the model performance. In this paper, we strike the balance of data privacy and efficiency by utilizing the pervasive social connections between users. Specifically, we propose SCFL, a novel <bold>S</bold>ocial-aware <bold>C</bold>lustered <bold>F</bold>ederated <bold>L</bold>earning scheme, where mutually trusted individuals can freely form a social cluster and aggregate their raw model updates (e.g., gradients) inside each cluster before uploading to the cloud for global aggregation. By mixing model updates in a social group, adversaries can only eavesdrop the social-layer combined results, but not the privacy of individuals. As such, SCFL considerably enhances model utility without sacrificing privacy in a low-cost and highly feasible manner. We unfold the design of SCFL in three steps. i) Stable social cluster formation. Considering users' heterogeneous training samples and data distributions, we formulate the optimal social cluster formation problem as a federation game and devise a fair revenue allocation mechanism to resist free-riders. ii) Differentiated trust-privacy mapping. For the clusters with low mutual trust, we design a customizable privacy preservation mechanism to adaptively sanitize participants' model updates depending on social trust degrees. iii) Distributed convergence. A distributed two-sided matching algorithm is devised to attain an optimized disjoint partition with Nash-stable convergence. Experiments on Facebook network and MNIST/CIFAR-10 datasets validate that our SCFL can effectively enhance learning utility, improve user payoff, and enforce customizable privacy protection.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a novel machine learning setting that enables on-device intelligence via decentralized training and federated optimization. Deep neural networks' rapid development facilitates the learning techniques for modeling complex problems and emerges into federated deep learning under the federated setting. However, the tremendous amount of model parameters burdens the communication network with a high load of transportation. This article introduces two approaches for improving communication efficiency by dynamic sampling and top-k selective masking. The former controls the fraction of selected client models dynamically, while the latter selects parameters with top-k largest values of difference for federated updating. Experiments on convolutional image classification and recurrent language modeling are conducted on three public datasets to show our proposed methods' effectiveness.

AB In Federated Learning (FL), varying local dataset distributions among clients can result in unsatisfactory performance for some, leading to an unfair model. While some prior works attempted to resolve this issue, their approaches fall short of training a fair model in real-world scenarios where imperfections in wireless channels cause the server to receive noisy versions of local updates. To tackle this issue, in this letter, we treat FL as a multi-objective minimization problem, and develop a fair FL algorithm that explicitly accounts for the inherent imperfections of wireless channels. Particularly, we modify the classical multiple gradient descent algorithm to assist the server in identifying a common descent direction for all local objectives based on the received noisy gradients. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method via some experiments.

ID EFFICIENT
AB This paper explores how to build a shapelet-based time series classification (TSC) model in the federated learning (FL) scenario, that is, using more data from multiple owners without actually sharing the data. We propose FedST, a novel federated TSC framework extended from a centralized shapelet transformation method. We recognize the federated shapelet search step as the kernel of FedST. Thus, we design a basic protocol for the FedST kernel that we prove to be secure and accurate. However, we identify that the basic protocol suffers from efficiency bottlenecks and the centralized acceleration techniques lose their efficacy due to the security issues. To speed up the federated protocol with security guarantee, we propose several optimizations tailored for the FL setting. Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed methods are secure and more efficient. We conduct extensive experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets. Empirical results show that our FedST solution is effective in terms of TSC accuracy, and the proposed optimizations can achieve three orders of magnitude of speedup.

AB Nowadays, Federated Learning (FL) over Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices has become a current research hotspot. As a new architecture, FL can well protect the data privacy of IoMT devices, but the security of neural network model transmission can not be guaranteed. On the other hand, the sizes of current popular neural network models are usually relatively extensive, and how to deploy them on the IoMT devices has become a challenge. One promising approach to these problems is to reduce the network scale by quantizing the parameters of the neural networks, which can greatly improve the security of data transmission and reduce the transmission cost. In the previous literature, the fixed-point quantizer with stochastic rounding has been shown to have better performance than other quantization methods. However, how to design such quantizer to achieve the minimum square quantization error is still unknown. In addition, how to apply this quantizer in the FL framework also needs investigation. To address these questions, in this paper, we propose FedMSQE - Federated Learning with Minimum Square Quantization Error, that achieves the smallest quantization error for each individual client in the FL setting. Through numerical experiments in both single-node and FL scenarios, we prove that our proposed algorithm can achieve higher accuracy and lower quantization error than other quantization methods.

AB Nowadays, researchers are investing their time and devoting their efforts in developing and motivating the 6G vision and resources that are not available in 5G. Edge computing and autonomous vehicular driving applications are more enhanced under the 6G services that are provided to successfully operate tasks. The huge volume of data resulting from such applications can be a plus in the AI and Machine Learning (ML) world. Traditional ML models are used to train their models on centralized data sets. Lately, data privacy becomes a real aspect to take into consideration while collecting data. For that, Federated Learning (FL) plays nowadays a great role in addressing privacy and technology together by maintaining the ability to learn over decentralized data sets. The training is limited to the user devices only while sharing the locally computed parameter with the server that aggregates those updated weights to optimize a global model. This scenario is repeated multiple rounds for better results and convergence. Most of the literature proposed client selection methods to converge faster and increase accuracy. However, none of them has targeted the ability to deploy and select clients in real-time wherever and whenever needed. In fact, some mobile and vehicular devices are not available to serve as clients in the FL due to the highly dynamic environments and/or do not have the capabilities to accomplish this task. In this paper, we address the aforementioned limitations by introducing an on-demand client deployment in FL offering more volume and heterogeneity of data in the learning process. We make use of containerization technology such as Docker to build efficient environments using any type of client devices serving as volunteering devices, and Kubernetes utility called Kubeadm to monitor the devices. The performed experiments illustrate the relevance of the proposed approach and the efficiency of the deployment of clients whenever and wherever needed.

AB Differential privacy techniques have shown excellent performance in protecting sensitive information during GAN model training. However, with the increasing attention to data privacy issues, ensuring high-quality output of generative models and the efficiency of federated learning while protecting privacy has become a pressing challenge. To address these issues, this paper proposes a One-shot Federated Personalized Protection-Generative Adversarial Network (OFPP-GAN). Firstly, this scheme employs dual personalized differential privacy to achieve privacy protection. It adjusts the noise scale and clipping threshold based on the gradient changes during model training in a personalized manner, thereby enhancing the performance of the generative model while protecting privacy. Additionally, the scheme adopts the one-shot federated learning paradigm, where each client uploads their local model containing private information only once throughout the training process. This approach not only reduces the risk of privacy leakage but also decreases the communication overhead of the entire system. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through theoretical analysis and experiments. Compared with existing methods, the generative model trained with OFPP-GAN demonstrates superior security, efficiency, and robustness.

AB Federated learning (FL) opens a new promising paradigm for the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) since it can collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing private data. However, deploying FL frameworks in real IoT scenarios faces three critical challenges, i.e., statistical heterogeneity, resource constraint, and fairness. To address these challenges, we design a fair and efficient FL method, termed FedASA, which can address the challenge of statistical heterogeneity in resource-constrained scenarios by determining the shared architecture adaptively. In FedASA, we first present a cell-wised shared architecture selection strategy, which can adaptively construct the shared architecture for each device. We then design a cell-based aggregation algorithm for aggregating heterogeneous shared architectures. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the federated error bound, which provides a theoretical guarantee for the fairness. At the same time, we prove the convergence of FedASA at the first-order stationary point. We evaluate the performance of FedASA through extensive simulation and experiments. Experimental results in cross-location scenarios show that FedASA outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches, improving accuracy by up to 13.27% with better fairness and faster convergence and communication requirement has been reduced by 81.49%.

DE Particle swarm optimization; Federated learning; Differential privacy;

AB In this paper, we present an unified framework that encompasses both particle swarm optimization (PSO) and federated learning (FL). This unified framework shows that we can understand both PSO and FL in terms of a function to be optimized by a set of agents but in which agents have different privacy requirements. PSO is the most relaxed case, and FL considers slightly stronger constraints. Even stronger privacy requirements can be considered which will lead to still stronger privacy-preserving solutions. Differentially private solutions as well as local differential privacy/reidentification privacy for agents opinions are the additional privacy models to be considered. In this paper, we discuss this framework and the different privacy-related alternatives. We present experiments that show how the additional privacy requirements degrade the results of the system. To that end, we consider optimization problems compatible with both PSO and FL.

AB In recent years, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made good progress in the medical field. The medical CPS (MCPS) based on AI can realize the efficient and reasonable utilization of medical resources and improve the quality of medical process. However, current MCPS are still facing several challenges, and the privacy protection of medical data is one of the most critical challenges. Since medical data is stored in different hospitals, most studies collect data from decentralized hospitals to train a disease diagnosis model, which is not conducive to the privacy protection of patients. And in some existing solutions, it is also difficult for doctors to select the optimal model from multiple models in clinical diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme based on federated learning in MCPS for training disease diagnosis models from distributed medical image data. Our scheme is divided into three parts: the model provider, the server, and the consumer, and a detailed working process is designed for each part. This scheme can not only effectively solve the problem of privacy protection, but also solve the problem of model selection for doctors and save storage space. It can ensure that consumers automatically get a steadily improved disease diagnosis model. This scheme is performed on simulated distributed medical image datasets. The experimental results show the effectiveness and superiority of our scheme.

AB Federated learning (FL), as one of novel machine learning frameworks, has been widely applied in edge computing (EC) fields. Most of the existing FL frameworks are implemented based on gradient descent (GD), and the training resources are assumed to be sufficient. However, in practical training, not all optimization problem can be well addressed by GD under FL framework in edge computing environment, and especially the edge resources are also limited. In this paper, based on the limited training resource and the FL framework, we study a kind of non-convex optimization problems, namely the gaussian mixture model (GMM), and propose an adaptive distributed expectation maximization (DEM) algorithm of GMM, which are not well addressed by using gradient descent. In particular, we analyze and give the convergence bound of the adaptive DEM. With the bound of adaptive DEM, we propose a local update control algorithm, which can achieve the best compromise between local update and global parameter aggregation of FL to achieve the maximization utilization of given resource budget. The experimental results demonstrate that adaptive DEM can well work out a kind of non-convex optimization problem under the FL framework and edge resource constrained environment.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a popular distributed learning paradigm, in which a global model at a server learns private data of clients without data shared among clients or the server. In this paper, we consider FL over a noisy fading multiple access channel (MAC) via over-the-air computation (AirComp). Benefiting from waveform-superposition propriety of wireless signals, AirComp is able to achieve fast aggregations in FL and improve spectral efficiency. However, most of the schemes exploiting AirComp require intensive channel estimations as the demands from precoders, which results in considerable communication overheads. For this reason, we propose two novel FL schemes with statistical channel state information (FL-SCSI-A and FL-SCSI-B) to reduce the efforts required by channel estimations. In FL-SCSI-A, precoders adjust phases of transmitted signals with phases of instant channel state information (CSI), and scale transmitted signal powers based on statistical CSI. The precoder design has the following two advantages. First, phases of instant CSI can be easier to estimate than complete instant CSI. Second, since clients only need to estimate phases of their own instant CSI (instead of CSI of all clients), with channel reciprocity, this can be easily achieved by letting the server broadcast pilots to all clients. The server in FL-SCSI-A is also efficient. It only needs to estimate the sum of channel gains of all clients, which can be easily achieved by letting clients transmit pilots simultaneously. To further reduce the communication overhead, FL-SCSI-B is proposed. The precoders in FL-SCSI-B are similar to FL-SCSI-A, while the server does not require any knowledge of instant CSI, which reduces the demands of channel estimations. For both schemes, we prove that the distortion caused by the noisy fading MAC is bounded, and the convergences of the learning processes are guaranteed for strongly smooth losses with heterogeneous data assumptions. Experimental results show that the proposed schemes perform better than benchmark schemes while reducing efforts required by channel estimation.

AB Federated learning provides a mechanism for different silos to collaborate, and each silo gets aid without compromising privacy. This simulation study is based on healthcare datasets, so the silos are hospitals or healthcare organizations. The selection of hospitals for federated learning increases the overall performance of the model. Cross-silo comes with many challenges, even though the number of participating clients is limited compared to cross-device federated learning. This study specifically addresses two of those aspects, heterogeneity of data and local performance. An approach called FedDSL based on 'Datasize', 'Skewness', and 'Local Performance' is introduced in this paper. Initially, synthetic data are generated considering the size of the data and skewness, which creates statistical heterogeneity in the cross-silo environment. Once this environment is created, a client selection strategy is applied that uses a weighted approach to select clients. A statistical analysis checks the data distributed among hospitals using skewness and normality tests. Experiments are conducted using the Flower Framework, and FedDSL is compared with random client selection. The model is applied with various aggregation algorithms, including FedAvg, FedProx, and FedAdam. The results show an increased model performance with the FedDSL approach compared to random client selection.

AB As a promising edge intelligence technology, federated learning (FL) enables Internet of Things (IoT) devices to train the models collaboratively while ensuring the data privacy and security. Recently, hierarchical FL (HFL) has been designed to promote distributed training in the intricate hierarchical structure of IoT. However, the coarse-grained hierarchical schemes usually fail to thoroughly adapt to the hierarchical environment, leading to high training latency. Meanwhile, highly heterogeneous communication and computation delays due to the device diversity (the system heterogeneity) and decentralized data distribution due to the decentralized device distribution (the data heterogeneity) exacerbate the above challenges. This article proposes NebulaFL, a dual heterogeneity-aware multilayer FL framework, to support efficient distributed training in IoT scenarios. NebulaFL proposes an innovative multilayer architecture organization scheme to adapt the complex hierarchical heterogeneous scenarios. Specifically, through a finer-grained division of the HFL hierarchy, hybrid synchronous-asynchronous training is implemented at both the global system and local device-layer levels. More importantly, to adaptively build a heterogeneity-aware hierarchical training architecture, NebulaFL considers the effect of dual heterogeneity in the architectural organization scheme to determine the optimal location of devices in a multilayer environment. To further improve the training efficiency during the training process, NebulaFL employs an augmented multiarmed bandit technique based on the reinforcement learning to adjust the device-layer training load by evaluating the dynamic training utility and convergence uncertainty feedback. Experiments demonstrate that NebulaFL achieves up to a $15.68\times $ speed-up ratio and a 23.94% increase in the training accuracy compared to the latest or classic approaches.

AB Federated Learning (FL) empowers wireless intelligent applications, by leveraging distributed data of edge clients for training without compromising privacy. Client selection is inevitable in FL, since clients have diversified learning capabilities arising from heterogeneous computing and communication resources. Existing methods like fair-selection and dropping-straggler are either inefficient or unfair (resulting in a less effective trained model). Therefore, we propose FedAoI, an Age-of-Information (AoI) based client selection policy. FedAoI ensures fairness by allowing all clients, including stragglers, to submit their model updates while maintaining high training efficiency by keeping round completion times short. This trade-off is achieved by minimizing Peak-AoI (PAoI), the interval between a client's consecutive participations. An optimization problem is formulated by minimizing the Expected-Weighted-Sum-of-PAoI. This NP-hard problem is addressed with a two-step sub-optimal algorithm, PriorS. It first calculates client priority in a round using Lyapunov optimization and then selects the highest-priority clients through G-FPFC (Greedy minimization of the round weighted-sum-of-PAoI with First-Priority-First-Considered). Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to fair-selection, FedAoI improves average efficiency by 83.8% and achieves an average model accuracy of 97.3% (or at the cost of averaging 2.7% degradation in model accuracy). Compared to dropping-straggler, FedAoI reduces the average model accuracy degradation from 9.5% to 2.7%.

ID COMMUNICATION-EFFICIENT
AB Training a machine learning model with federated edge learning (FEEL) is typically time consuming due to the constrained computation power of edge devices and the limited wireless resources in edge networks. In this study, the training time minimization problem is investigated in a quantized FEEL system, where heterogeneous edge devices send quantized gradients to the edge server via orthogonal channels. In particular, a stochastic quantization scheme is adopted for compression of uploaded gradients, which can reduce the burden of per-round communication but may come at the cost of increasing the number of communication rounds. The training time is modeled by taking into account the communication time, computation time, and the number of communication rounds. Based on the proposed training time model, the intrinsic trade-off between the number of communication rounds and per-round latency is characterized. Specifically, we analyze the convergence behavior of the quantized FEEL in terms of the optimality gap. Furthermore, a joint data-and-model-driven fitting method is proposed to obtain the exact optimality gap, based on which the closed-form expressions for the number of communication rounds and the total training time are obtained. Constrained by the total bandwidth, the training time minimization problem is formulated as a joint quantization level and bandwidth allocation optimization problem. To this end, an algorithm based on alternating optimization is proposed, which alternatively solves the subproblem of quantization optimization through successive convex approximation and the subproblem of bandwidth allocation by bisection search. With different learning tasks and models, the validation of our analysis and the near-optimal performance of the proposed optimization algorithm are demonstrated by the simulation results.

AB Environmental issues such as environmental pollutions and climate change are the impacts of globalization and become debatable issues among academics and industry key players. One of the environmental issues which is air pollution has been catching attention among industrialists, researchers, and communities around the world. However, it has always neglected until the impacts on human health become worse, and at times, irreversible. Human exposure to air pollutant such as particulate matters, sulfur dioxide, ozone and carbon monoxide contributed to adverse health hazards which result in respiratory diseases, cardiorespiratory diseases, cancers, and worst, can lead to death. This has led to a spike increase of hospitalization and emergency department visits especially at areas with worse pollution cases that seriously impacting human life and health. To address this alarming issue, a predictive model of air pollution is crucial in assessing the impacts of health due to air pollution. It is also critical in predicting the air quality index when assessing the risk contributed by air pollutant exposure. Hence, this systemic review explores the existing studies on anticipating air quality impact to human health using the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI). From the extensive review, we highlighted research gaps in this field that are worth to inquire. Our study proposes to develop an AI-based integrated environmental and health impact assessment system using federated learning. This is specifically aims to identify the association of health impact and pollution based on socio-economic activities and predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) for impact assessment. The output of the system will be utilized for hospitals and healthcare services management and planning. The proposed solution is expected to accommodate the needs of the critical and prioritization of sensitive group of publics during pollution seasons. Our finding will bring positive impacts to the society in terms of improved healthcare services quality, environmental and health sustainability. The findings are beneficial to local authorities either in healthcare or environmental monitoring institutions especially in the developing countries.

DE indoor navigation; learning (artificial intelligence)
AB To identify non-line-of-sight, acoustics-based indoor positioning needs to collect audio recordings of sound fields in multiple rooms and upload them to the central server for training. However, if the transmission process or the server-side suffers from malicious attacks, private data may be leaked. To address both training difficulties and privacy issues simultaneously, a novel model for personalized federated learning is proposed. This model incorporates user frequency and room data capacity while also taking into account significant differences in positioning data and room layout. The proposed model can accurately identify differences between various room data during aggregation on the server-side. By collecting data in actual indoor environments and comparing it with existing algorithms, the proposed method achieved 90% accuracy in verifying data for unfamiliar rooms.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a popular approach to facilitate privacy-aware machine learning since it allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without granting others access to their private data. It is, however, known that FL can be vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), where the training records of the global model can be distinguished from the testing records. Surprisingly, research focusing on the investigation of the source inference problem appears to be lacking. We also observe that identifying a training record's source client can result in privacy breaches extending beyond MIAs. Seeking to contribute to the literature gap, we take the first step to investigate source privacy in FL. Specifically, we propose a new inference attack (hereafter referred to as source inference attack-SIA), designed to facilitate an honest-but-curious server to identify the training record's source client. The proposed SIAs leverage the Bayesian theorem to implement the attack in a non-intrusive manner without deviating from the defined FL protocol. We then evaluate SIAs in three different FL frameworks to show that in existing FL frameworks, the clients sharing gradients, model parameters, or predictions on a public dataset will leak such source information to the server. The experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed SIAs, e.g., an attack success rate of 67.1% (baseline 10%) can be achieved when the clients share model parameters with the server. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate that the success of an SIA is directly related to the overfitting of the local models.

AB Federated learning (FL) has been recognized as a promising distributed learning paradigm to support intelligent applications at the wireless edge, where a global model is trained iteratively through the collaboration of the edge devices without sharing their data. However, due to the relatively large communication cost between the devices and parameter server (PS), direct computing based on the information from the devices may not be resource efficient. This paper studies the joint communication and learning design for the over-the-air computation (AirComp)-based two-tier wireless FL scheme, where the lead devices first collect the local gradients from their nearby subordinate devices, and then send the merged results to the PS for the second round of aggregation. We establish a convergence result for the proposed scheme and derive the upper bound on the optimality gap between the expected and optimal global loss values. Next, based on the device distance and data importance, we propose a hierarchical clustering method to build the two-tier structure. Then, with only the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), we formulate the optimality gap minimization problem and solve it by using an efficient alternating minimization method. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline ones.

AB We study the gradient aggregation in over-the-air federated learning (OA-FL), where the parameter server (PS) uses a combining vector to estimate the aggregated gradient. We propose a novel channel-estimation-free (CE-Free) gradient aggregation scheme for OA-FL, where the combining vector at the PS is trained based on the sample average approximation (SAA) method. We analyse the aggregation performance of the proposed scheme based on the large deviation theory (LDT). In the proposed scheme, the required number of training symbols is irrelevant to the number of devices, which significantly reduces the communication cost when the FL system consists of a large number of devices. Numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB Aerial base stations (AeBSs), as crucial components of air-ground integrated networks, are widely employed in cloud computing, disaster relief, and various applications. How to quickly and efficiently deploy multi-AeBSs for higher capacity gain has become a key research issue. In this paper, we address the 3D deployment optimization problem of multi-AeBSs with the objective of maximizing system capacity. To overcome communication overhead and privacy challenges in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), we propose a federated deep deterministic policy gradient (Fed-DDPG) algorithm for the multi-AeBS deployment decision. Specifically, a high-altitude platform (HAP)-assisted multi-AeBS deployment architecture is designed, in which low-altitude AeBS act as the local nodes to train its own deployment decision model, while the HAP acts as the global node to aggregate the weights of local models. In this architecture, AeBSs do not exchange raw data, addressing data privacy concerns and reducing communication overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms fully distributed MADRL algorithms and closely approximates the performance of multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), which requires global information during training, but with less training time.

AB An edge intelligence-aided Internet-of-Things (IoT) network has been proposed to accelerate the response of IoT services by deploying edge intelligence near IoT devices. The transmission of data from IoT devices to the edge nodes leads to large network traffic in the wireless connections. Federated Learning (FL) is proposed to solve the high computational complexity by training the model locally on IoT devices and sharing the model parameters in the edge nodes. This paper focuses on developing an efficient integration of joint edge intelligence nodes depending on investigating an energy-efficient bandwidth allocation, computing Central Processing Unit (CPU) frequency, optimization transmission power, and the desired level of learning accuracy to minimize the energy consumption and satisfy the FL time requirement for all IoT devices. The proposal efficiently optimized the computation frequency allocation and reduced energy consumption in IoT devices by solving the bandwidth optimization problem in closed form. The remaining computational frequency allocation, transmission power allocation, and loss could be resolved with an Alternative Direction Algorithm (ADA) to reduce energy consumption and complexity at every iteration of FL time from IoT devices to edge intelligence nodes. The simulation results indicated that the proposed ADA can adapt the central processing unit frequency and power transmission control to reduce energy consumption at the cost of a small growth of FL time.

AB Federated learning (FL) has become an increasingly popular solution for intrusion detection to avoid data privacy leakage in Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices. Existing FL-based intrusion detection methods, however, suffer from three limitations: 1) model parameters transmitted in each round may be used to recover private data, which leads to security risks; 2) not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) private data seriously adversely affect the training of FL (especially distillation-based FL); and 3) high communication overhead caused by the large model size greatly hinders the actual deployment of the solution. To address these problems, this article develops an intrusion detection method based on a semisupervised FL scheme via knowledge distillation. First, our proposed method leverages unlabeled data via distillation method to enhance the classifier performance. Second, we build a model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for extracting deep features of the traffic packets, and take this model as both the classifier network and discriminator network. Third, the discriminator is designed to improve the quality of each client's predicted labels, and to avoid the failure of distillation training caused by a large number of incorrect predictions under private non-IID data. Moreover, the combination of the hard-label strategy and voting mechanism further reduces communication overhead. The experiments on the real-world traffic data set with three non-IID scenarios show that our proposed method can achieve better detection performance as well as lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art methods.

TI FedMMD: A Federated weighting algorithm considering Non-IID and Local
   Model Deviation
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

   weight method
AB Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning method to protect users' privacy and security. It currently faces the following two problems (McMahan et al., 2017): (1) The performance of the global model degrades when dealing with Non-Independent Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data. Other existing classical methods do not have a rigorous theory based on error processing ; (2) In the process of global model aggregation, the classical FL algorithm either directly averages local models or solely considers the proportion of local data to assign weights to the models, without accounting for the discrepancies between the local models. In this paper, a federated aggregation algorithm Federated Maximum Mean Discrepancy (FedMMD) is proposed to address the deviation between the local models and Non-IID. First of all, this paper utilizes the Dilated Convolution Meet Transformer (DCMT) model for local model feature extraction. This approach aims to capture more feature information and minimize the impact of Non-IID scenarios. Secondly, the learning stability of the local model data participating in the aggregation is compared with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The weights of the local models involved in the aggregation are determined using the SKNQ (Student-Keuls-Newman-Q) method and the entropy weight method. The SKNQ method calculates and compares the MMD across multiple clients, while the entropy weight method assigns different weights to clients based on their deviations. On the standard dataset, the FedAvg algorithm (McMahan et al., 2017), the FedProx algorithm (Li et al., 2020) and the FedMMD algorithm are compared. The experimental results demonstrate that the FedMMD algorithm, used in training the global model, not only enhances the accuracy of learning IID and Non-IID data but also improves the generalization capability of the global model.

AB Advanced metering infrastructures (AMIs) aim to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and stability of electrical systems while offering advanced functionality. However, an AMI collects copious volumes of data and information, making the entire system sensitive and vulnerable to malicious attacks that may cause substantial damage, such as a deficit in national security, a disturbance of public order, or significant economic harm. As a result, it is critical to guarantee a steady and dependable supply of information and electricity. Furthermore, storing massive quantities of data in one central entity leads to compromised data privacy. As such, it is imperative to engineer decentralized, federated learning (FL) solutions. In this context, the performance of participating clients has a significant impact on global performance. Moreover, FL models have the potential for a Single Point of Failure (SPoF). These limitations contribute to system failure and performance degradation. This work aims to develop a performance-based hierarchical federated learning (HFL) anomaly detection system for an AMI through (1) developing a deep learning model that detects attacks against this critical infrastructure; (2) developing a novel aggregation strategy, FedAvg-P, to enhance global performance; and (3) proposing a peer-to-peer architecture guarding against a SPoF. The proposed system was employed in experiments on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can be used to develop a reliable anomaly detection system for AMI networks.

DT Article
DE IoT; federated learning; gesture recognition; CSI
AB Gesture recognition plays an important role in smart homes, such as human-computer interaction, identity authentication, etc. Most of the existing WiFi signal-based approaches exploit a large number of channel state information (CSI) datasets to train a gestures classification model; however, these models require a large number of human participants to train, and are not robust to the recognition environment. To address this problem, we propose a WiFi signal-based gesture recognition system with matched averaging federated learning (WiMA). Since there are differences in the distribution of WiFi signal changes caused by the same gesture in different environments, the traditional federated parameter average algorithm seriously affects the recognition accuracy of the model. In WiMA, we exploit the neuron arrangement invariance of neural networks in parameter aggregation, which can improve the robustness of the gesture recognition model with heterogeneous CSI data of different training environments. We carried out experiments with seven participant users in a distributed gesture recognition environment. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of our proposed system is up to 90.4%, which is very close to the accuracy of state-of-the-art approaches with centralized training models.

AB Privacy and data security have become the new hot topic for regulators in recent years. As a result, Federated Learning (FL) (also called collaborative learning) has emerged as a new training paradigm that allows multiple, geographically distributed nodes to learn a Deep Learning (DL) model together without sharing their data. Blockchain is becoming a new trend as data protection and privacy are concerns in many sectors. Technology is leading the world and transforming into a global village where everything is accessible and transparent. We have presented a blockchain enabled security model using FL that can generate an enhanced DL model without sharing data and improve privacy through higher security and access rights to data. However, existing FL approaches also have unique security vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit and compromise the trained model. The FL method is compared to the other known approaches. Users are more likely to choose the latter option, i.e., providing local but private data to the server and using ML apps, performing ML operations on the devices without benefiting from other users' data, and preventing direct access to raw data and local training of ML models. FL protects data privacy and reduces data transfer overhead by storing raw data on devices and combining locally computed model updates. We have investigated the feasibility of data and model poisoning attacks under a blockchain-enabled FL system built alongside the Ethereum network and the traditional FL system (without blockchain). This work fills a knowledge gap by proposing a transparent incentive mechanism that can encourage good behavior among participating decentralized nodes and avoid common problems and provides knowledge for the FL security literature by investigating current FL systems.

AB Compared to the modularized rule-based framework, end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have demonstrated greater adaptability in autonomous driving (AD) scenarios. However, DRL algorithms often face challenges related to model convergence and sample dependence, which limit their applicability to complex driving tasks and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we present a novel hybrid algorithm framework called federated learning (FL)-based distributed proximal policy optimization (FLDPPO). This framework combines modularized rule-based complex network cognition and end-to-end DRL to realize the fusion driving of the mechanism model and data. Our algorithm generates dynamic driving recommendations that guide agent learning rules, enabling the model to handle complex driving environments. In addition, FLDPPO addresses model robustness and sample dependence issues through a model confidence-based distributed multiagent aggregation architecture. By measuring model confidence, the architecture learns to effectively aggregate knowledge from each unique experience distribution. Simulation results show that the proposed FLDPPO algorithm achieves competitive performance on various benchmarks.

ID CHALLENGES
AB Digital twin technology deployed in the industrial Internet of Things (IoT) will be unavailable because of data heterogeneity and data islands. As a machine learning approach for distributed architectures, federated learning generates a global model for edge devices by only transferring model parameters, and it ensures that the private data of each device is not leaked. This is naturally suitable for solving this problem. Because devices' data cannot be exchanged with other devices, one major challenge is learning an effective model among devices with heterogeneous data. Motivated by this issue, we propose hierarchical federated learning using a hypernetwork (HN) algorithm to alleviate the influence of non-IID data among the devices, including label distribution skew, quantity skew, and feature distribution skew. The lower layer of our method uses hypernetworks to generate the parameters of the local model for the devices, while its upper layer updates hypernetworks by aggregating their model parameters. It decouples the number of parameters transmitted by the upper and lower layers, and it achieves good accuracy while improving communication efficiency and reducing computation costs.

AB As a hot technology trend, the federated learning (FL) cleverly combines data utilization and privacy protection by processing data locally on the client and only sharing model parameters with the server, embodying an efficient and secure collaborative learning model between clients and aggregated Servers. During the process of uploading parameters in FL models, there is susceptibility to unauthorized access threats, which can result in training data leakage. To ensure data security during transmission, the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocols are proposed to authenticate legitimate users and safeguard training data. However, existing AKA protocols for client-server (C/S) architecture show security deficiencies, such as lack of user anonymity and susceptibility to password guessing attacks. In this paper, we propose a robust 2FAKA-C/S protocol based on ECC and Hash-chain technology. Our security analysis shows that the proposed protocol ensures the session keys are semantically secure and can effectively resist various attacks. The performance analysis indicates that the proposed protocol achieves a total running time of 62.644 ms and requires only 800 bits of communication overhead, showing superior computational efficiency and lower communication costs compared to existing protocols. In conclusion, the proposed protocol securely protects the training parameters in a federated learning environment and provides a reliable guarantee for data transmission.

AB In this letter, we explore the process of transmitting model parameters for federated learning (FL) across cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) networks. We conduct a theoretical analysis to examine the impact of wireless transmission errors on the parameter updating process of the FL model within the framework of CFmMIMO networks. In particular, we ingeniously reformulate the optimization problem of minimizing the loss function in FL by substituting the loss function with the packet error rate function and eventually approximating it as a tractable closed-form expression. Taking the impact of wireless resource allocation on the efficacy of FL into account, we specialize in the optimization of uplink transmission power to minimize the packet error rate function. The fractional programming (FP) algorithm is employed to perform a quadratic transformation of the objective function, facilitating the transformation of the initial non-convex problem into a convex problem. The results derived from the simulation demonstrate that the implementation of the power control strategy yields a significant reduction of 84.3% in the equivalent loss function.

TI TOWARD ENERGY-EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTED FEDERATED LEARNING FOR 6G NETWORKS
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB The provision of communication services via portable and mobile devices, such as aerial base stations, is a crucial concept to be realized in 5G/6G networks. Conventionally, IoT/edge devices need to transmit data directly to the base station for training the model using machine learning techniques. The data transmission introduces privacy issues that might lead to security concerns and monetary losses. Recently, federated learning was proposed to partially solve privacy issues via model sharing with the base station. However, the centralized nature of federated learning only allows the devices within the vicinity of base stations to share trained models. Furthermore, the long-range communication compels the devices to increase transmission power, which raises energy efficiency concerns. In this work, we propose the distributed federated learning (DBFL) framework that overcomes the connectivity and energy efficiency issues for distant devices. The DBFL framework is compatible with mobile edge computing architecture that connects the devices in a distributed manner using clustering protocols. Experimental results show that the framework increases the classification performance by 7.4 percent in comparison to conventional federated learning while reducing the energy consumption.

AB Network slicing has emerged as a crucial technology in modern communication networks, especially in the context of 5G and beyond. Network slices offer virtualized and isolated segments tailored to the specific applications and services. However, the inherent isolation imposes security challenges, limiting the slice's ability to learn from all data sources. This paper proposes EDgE, a novel solution leveraging federated learning (FL) to address these concerns. The proposed framework leverages FL to facilitate learning from diverse data sources, enabling each slice to conduct local machine learning (ML) model training with encrypted model updates shared among intra and inter-communication service providers (CSPs). The EDgE framework enables dynamic selection of parameters for learning and optimizing specific attributes based on the slice type and requirements. This ensures that each slice receives tailored optimization strategies depending on their type, maximizing their efficiency. While intra-CSP data sharing presents challenges, proposing inter-CSP slice data sharing introduces additional complexities. To enhance data security and privacy, the framework utilizes Blockchain as a distributed ledger, ensuring immutability, and trust among CSPs. The EDgE architecture is simulated using production-grade Network Slice Management (NSM) and Cloud Orchestrator on real-world 4G datasets and NSL-KDD intrusion detection datasets. Test results show that EDgE rapidly converges to high accuracy, ultimately achieving 97.6% across different scenarios, outperforming legacy systems and enhancing the security of the NSM ecosystem.

DE Federated learning (FL); Client selection; Internet of Things (IoT);

AB In cross-device Federated Learning (FL) the existing client selection approaches are centralized, making the assumption that the participatory clients are resource-full and restrict their type to mobile phones. These assumptions limit the applications of FL and make it difficult for the global server to monitor the client (s) resources; as a consequence of which a high client drop-out rate is observed. Thus, a distributed cross-device FL framework with the provision of resource & time-aware client selection is required. This paper proposes a distributed cross-device FL client selection framework (FedDCS) which employs a novel data-type, resource, and time-aware protocol for FL client selection. FedDCS is designed to offload the client selection and their resource monitoring processes to the local edge servers with the objective to minimize client(s) drop-outs, model convergence time, number of message exchanges, and time to achieve a certain level of accuracy. Extensive experiments on two benchmark data sets: MNIST and FashionMNIST, are performed on the PyTorch-based FL platform to evaluate the performance of FedDCS on such metrics. The results show 100% client retention in FedDCS during FL model training for both MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets using IID and Non-IID settings. For the MNIST dataset, FedDCS shows 82% and 36% improvement in the time taken to reach the desired testing accuracy, and 18% and 10% improvement in model convergence time, for IID and Non-IID setting respectively as compared to the best performing state-of-the-art, i.e., FedMCCS. For the FashionMNIST dataset, FedDCS shows 17% and 6% improvement in the time taken to reach the desired testing accuracy, and 4% and 1% improvement in model convergence time, for IID and Non-IID setting respectively as compared to the best performing state-of-the-art, i.e., FedMCCS. In addition, FedDCS also significantly reduces the number of message exchanges during FL. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and Objective: In traditional Machine Learning (ML) approaches, the data are collected and stored by a single node and subsequently used for training and testing. However, the acquisition and management of a large amount of data in some domains, as for example healthcare, can be problematic on account of the adoption of centralized architectures which entail certain security and privacy risks.
   Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a technological solution to address such questions, even though communication efficiency may be a significant issue.
   Methods: This paper presents a novel learning strategy aimed at reducing the total number of parameters shared during the FL process and therefore, at evaluating a trade-off between the requirement to bring down communication costs and the need to guarantee the highest classification performance.
   Results: The results demonstrate the goodness of the solution in comparison with the traditional FedAvg algorithm since the accuracy of the proposed approach shows values ranging from 89.25% to 96.6% and, and in addition, the reduction of the communication overheads shows improvements ranging from 95.64% to 6%.
   Conclusion: The analysis of the proposed approach shows promising results in terms of performance and communication costs, especially in relation to the total amount of moved data since the challenge addressed by the paper concerns communication efficiency during the training process.

AB Leveraging various mobile devices to train the shared model collaboratively, federated learning (FL) can improve the privacy and security of 6G communication. To economically encourage the participation of heterogeneous mobile devices, an incentive mechanism and a fair trading platform are needed. In this paper, we implement a blockchain-based FL system and propose an incentive mechanism to establish a decentralized and transparent trading platform. Moreover, to better understand the mobile devices' behaviors, we provide economic analysis for this market. Specifically, we propose two strategy models for mobile devices, namely the discrete strategy model (DSM) and the continuous strategy model (CSM). Also, we formulate the interactions among the non-cooperative mobile devices as a dynamic game, where they adjust their strategies iteratively to maximize the individual payoff based on others' previous strategies. We further prove the existence in Nash equilibrium (NE) of two different models and propose algorithms to achieve them. Simulation results demonstrate the convergence of the proposed algorithms and show that the CSM can effectively increase the mobile devices' payoffs to 128.1 percent at most compared with DSM.

AB In Federated Learning (FL), clients may have weak devices that cannot train the full model or even hold it in their memory space. To implement large-scale FL applications, thus, it is crucial to develop a distributed learning method that enables the participation of such weak clients. We propose EmbracingFL , a general FL framework that allows all available clients to join the distributed training regardless of their system resource capacity. The framework is built upon a novel form of partial model training method in which each client trains as many consecutive output-side layers as its system resources allow. Our study demonstrates that EmbracingFL encourages each layer to have similar data representations across clients, improving FL efficiency. The proposed partial model training method guarantees convergence to a neighbor of stationary points for non-convex and smooth problems. We evaluate the efficacy of EmbracingFL under a variety of settings with a mixed number of strong, moderate ( similar to 40% memory), and weak ( similar to 15% memory) clients, datasets (CIFAR-10, FEMNIST, and IMDB), and models (ResNet20, CNN, and LSTM). Our empirical study shows that EmbracingFL consistently achieves high accuracy as like all clients are strong, outperforming the state-of-the-art width reduction methods (i.e., HeteroFL and FjORD).

To address this issue, this research proposes a novel spatiotemporal federated learning-based regional distributed photovoltaic ultra-short-term power forecasting method. First, the power forecasting model is trained with federated learning to achieve correlation information sharing by the model interaction. Then, considering that the information shared by model interaction is very limited, a spatiotemporal correlation modeling method based on temporal feature sharing is proposed. Based on this dual information sharing mechanism, effective mining of spatiotemporal correlation information is realized and the accuracy of power forecasting can be enhanced. Under this framework, the central server only generates global models and features without aggregating raw power data, and local users only need to share local model and temporal feature information. Therefore, user data privacy can be protected. Finally, the effect of the proposed method is verified via a China's dataset.

AB A novel asynchronous federated architecture is proposed in this work for data prediction, aggregation, and inference with a use case for fast short-term instability mitigation in transmission systems. Existing machine learning (ML) prediction approaches rely on centralized-schemes that accumulate measurements from distributed regions at a central computing node. This centralized-schemes increase computational overhead leading to prediction delay. Federated-learning collaboratively learns a global model without centralized data processing. Nevertheless, its performance degrades when data becomes non-independent and identically-distributed due to the changes in grid dynamics, leading to expensive model re-training. This research proposes a federated-inference architecture that can exploit data-dependency in different regions to effectively exchange model parameters among high-quality local models and improve local predictive results, hence avoiding the need for global model and re-training effort. The architecture includes several major modules: 1) federated deep ML models using gated-recurrent unit for local synchrophasor data prediction in each region, 2) computationally-efficient data anomaly detection and mitigation using statistical and unsupervised autoencoders, 3) a federated inference algorithm that aggregates model weights and outputs from top-k correlated neighbors to improve local performance, upon system dynamics change, 4) instability prediction and 5) a case analysis for its application in proactive short-term stability control. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on modified IEEE test systems with multiple test event scenarios with varying factors, including number of PMUs, error tolerances, and length of input and prediction windows.

ID CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS; AGGREGATION; DESIGN
AB We examine federated learning (FL) with over-the-air (OTA) aggregation, where mobile users (MUs) aim to reach a consensus on a global model with the help of a parameter server (PS) that aggregates the local gradients. In OTA FL, MUs train their models using local data at every training round and transmit their gradients simultaneously using the same frequency band in an uncoded fashion. Based on the received signal of the superposed gradients, the PS performs a global model update. While the OTA FL has a significantly decreased communication cost, it is susceptible to adverse channel effects and noise. Employing multiple antennas at the receiver side can reduce these effects, yet the path-loss is still a limiting factor for users located far away from the PS. To ameliorate this issue, in this paper, we propose a wireless-based hierarchical FL scheme that uses intermediate servers (ISs) to form clusters in the areas where the MUs are more densely located. Our scheme utilizes OTA cluster aggregations for the communication of the MUs with their corresponding IS, and OTA global aggregations from the ISs to the PS. We present a convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm, and show through numerical evaluations of the derived analytical expressions and experimental results that utilizing ISs results in a faster convergence and a better performance than the OTA FL alone while using less transmit power. We also validate the results on the performance using different numbers of cluster iterations with different datasets and data distributions. We conclude that the best choice of cluster aggregations depends on the data distribution among the MUs and the clusters.

AB Federated Learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for mining massive data while respecting users' privacy. However, the deployment of FL on resource-constrained edge devices remains elusive due to its high resource demand. In this paper, unlike existing works that use expensive dense models, we propose to utilize dynamic sparse training in FL and design a novel sparse-to-sparse FL framework, named as POP-FL. The framework can reduce both computation and communication overheads while maintaining the performance of the global model. Specifically, POP-FL partitions massive clients into groups and performs parallel parameter exploration, i.e., Parallel Over-Parameterization, over the collaboration between these groups. This exploration can greatly improve the expressibility and generalizability of sparse training in FL (especially for extreme sparsity levels) through reliably covering sufficient parameters and dynamically updating the global sparse network's structure during the training process. Experimental results show that compared with existing sparse-to-sparse training methods in both iid and non-iid data distribution, POP-FL achieves the best inference accuracy on various representative networks.

AB Big data enables the optimization of complex supply chains through Machine Learning (ML) based data analytics. However, data analytics comes with challenges such as the loss of control and privacy leading to increased risk of data breaches. Federated Learning (FL) is an approach in the ML arena that promises privacy-preserving and distributed model training. However, recent attacks on FL algorithms have raised concerns about the security of this approach. In this article, we advocate using Blockchain to mitigate attacks on FL algorithms operating in Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Integrating Blockchain and FL allows securing the trained models' integrity, thus preventing model poisoning attacks. This research presents a practical approach for the integration of Blockchain with FL to provide privacy preserving and secure big data analytics services. To protect the security of user data and the trained models, we propose utilizing fuzzy hashing to detect variations and anomalies in FL-trained models against poisoning attacks. The proposed solution is evaluated via simulating attack modes in a quasi-simulated environment. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Health prognostics within the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm face several challenges, including data privacy, client drift, and prediction accuracy. Federated learning (FL), as an emerging decentralized machine learning paradigm, has the potential to address these challenges by integrating multiple data silos in a distributed and privacy-preserved fashion. This article develops a novel personalized federated transfer learning (PFTL) framework for customized health prognosis of multiple heterogeneous clients. The framework starts with a powerful initial global prognostic model that is pretrained using a publicly available data set in a central server. The pretrained global model is then distributed to the local clients and fine-tuned separately on their respective private data sets. The fine-tuned local prognostic models are uploaded to the central server for dynamic weighted model aggregation. The aggregated model is then distributed to each client for implementing domain adversarial training to obtain a fine-grained local prognostic model. The proposed PFTL framework embeds a multiscale attention module and a multihead self-attention module parallelly into the deep learning-based prognostic model, which is shared between the central server and each local client. Through experimental verifications from lab testing-based and open-source fast-charging lithium-ion batteries data sets, we demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve accurate cycle-life prediction without compromising data privacy.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB A fundamental issue for federated learning (FL) is how to achieve efficient training performance under complex dynamic communication environments. This issue can be alleviated by the fact that modern edge devices usually can connect to the edge server via multiple communication channels (e.g., 4G, LTE, and 5G) because multi-channel communication can increase the communication bandwidth and has lower communication costs and energy consumption than a single high-speed communication channel. However, if the communication data cannot be properly allocated to multiple channels in a complex dynamic communication network, multi-channel communication will still waste resources (e.g., bandwidth, battery life, and monetary cost). In this paper, we propose an efficient FL framework called, which consists of two parts, the layered gradient compression (LGC), and a learning-driven control algorithm. Specifically, with LGC, local gradients from a device are coded into several layers, and each layer is sent to the server along a different channel. The FL server aggregates the received layers of local gradients from devices to update the global model and sends the result back to the devices. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of LGC and formally define the problem of resource-efficient with LGC. We then propose a learning-driven algorithm for each device to dynamically adjust its local computation (i.e., the number of local stochastic descent) and communication decisions (i.e., the compression level of different layers and the layer-to-channel mapping) in each iteration. Results from extensive experiments show that significantly reduces the training time and improves the resource utilization (energy consumption and money cost) while achieving a similar test accuracy compared with well-known FL baselines.

TI Model-level attention and batch-instance style normalization for
   federated learning on medical image segmentation
SO INFORMATION FUSION
LA English

   Attention; Style normalization
AB Federated learning (FL) offers an effective privacy protection mechanism for cross -center medical collaboration and data sharing. In multi -site medical image segmentation, FL allows each medical site to act as a client, forming its own data domain. FL has the potential to enhance the performance of models on known domains. However, practical deployment faces the challenge of domain generalization (DG) due to the non -identical and non -independent (non-IID) nature of data from different domains. This results in decreased model performance in unseen domains. Current DG solutions are overly complex in addressing style differences and lack focus on inter -domain image features causing model differences. Furthermore, these solutions are not suitable for the FL paradigm that requires data storage separation. Hence, the lightweight model -level attention and batch -instance style normalization (MLA-BIN) is proposed to solve the DG of FL in this study. The MLA module represents the unseen domain as a linear combination of seen domain models. It does not require access to raw data but learns from the sufficient exploration of data features in known domains, thereby identifying differences in interdomain data features and enabling the global model to generalize from seen to unseen domains. In the BIN block, batch normalization (BN) and instance normalization (IN) are combined to perform the shallow layers of the segmentation network for style normalization. By integrating the segmentation backbone network with the BIN block (BIN-Net), it ensures effective learning of intra-domain features and addresses the impact of interdomain image style differences on domain generalization without accessing data from other centers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 88.27, 88.25 and 64.94 on the prostate, the optic disc and cup, and the COVID-19 lesion segmentation dataset, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

AB As a novel distributed machine learning scheme, federated learning (FL) efficiently realizes the collaborative training of models by global participants while also protecting their data privacy. Due to the independence of participants' local data and the inability of the FL server to access the local data, many IIoT applications with strong data sensitivity are increasingly incorporating FL technology. However, it also exposes a great security vulnerability. Malicious adversaries manipulate local data to perform covert targeted poisoning attacks or other harmful behaviors to affect the global model. In addition, due to the diversity of IIoT data in actual scenarios, different data distribution scenarios can also cause different attack effects.
   In this work, we devise a defense technique called FDSFL against multiple malicious adversaries and various targeted poisoning attacks involving both IID and non-IID data distribution scenarios. It runs on the server-side and mainly includes three execution modules: pairwise cosine similarity, clustering mechanism, and filtering strategy, which can dynamically filter malicious updates during the iterative training process. We demonstrate that our designed FDSFL outperforms the state-of-the-art in maintaining global model accuracy and reducing attack success rates through extensive experiments on three general datasets.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Human skin disease, the most infectious dermatological ailment globally, is initially diagnosed by sight. Some clinical screening and dermoscopic analysis of skin biopsies and scrapings for accurate classification are medically compulsory. Classification of skin diseases using medical images is more challenging because of the complex formation and variant colors of the disease and data security concerns. Both the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for classification and a federated learning approach for data privacy preservation show significant performance in the realm of medical imaging fields. In this paper, a custom image dataset was prepared with four classes of skin disease, a CNN model was suggested and compared with several benchmark CNN algorithms, and an experiment was carried out to ensure data privacy using a federated learning approach. An image augmentation strategy was followed to enlarge the dataset and make the model more general. The proposed model achieved a precision of 86%, 43%, and 60%, and a recall of 67%, 60%, and 60% for acne, eczema, and psoriasis. In the federated learning approach, after distributing the dataset among 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 clients, the model showed an average accuracy of 81.21%, 86.57%, 91.15%, and 94.15%. The CNN-based skin disease classification merged with the federated learning approach is a breathtaking concept to classify human skin diseases while ensuring data security.

AB In federated learning (FL), the communication constraint between the remote clients and the Parameter Server (PS) is a crucial bottleneck. For this reason, model updates must be compressed so as to minimize the loss in accuracy resulting from the communication constraint. This paper proposes "M-magnitude weighted L2 distortion + 2 degrees of freedom" (M22) algorithm, a rate-distortion inspired approach to gradient compression for federated training of deep neural networks (DNNs). In particular, we propose a family of distortion measures between the original gradient and the reconstruction we referred to as " $M$ -magnitude weighted $L_{2}$ " distortion, and we assume that gradient updates follow an i.i.d. distribution - generalized normal or Weibull, which have two degrees of freedom. In both the distortion measure and the gradient distribution, there is one free parameter for each that can be fitted as a function of the iteration number. Given a choice of gradient distribution and distortion measure, we design the quantizer to minimize the expected distortion in gradient reconstruction. To measure the gradient compression performance under a communication constraint, we define the per-bit accuracy as the optimal improvement in accuracy that one bit of communication brings to the centralized model over the training period. Using this performance measure, we systematically benchmark the choice of gradient distribution and distortion measure. We provide substantial insights on the role of these choices and argue that significant performance improvements can be attained using such a rate-distortion inspired compressor.

AB Resource allocation is a fundamental research issue in IoT edge computing, and reinforcement learning is fast becoming a common solution. The majority of the current techniques involve decision makers who determine how and where resources should be distributed. In a standard cloud system, this decision maker is a central server. In an edge system, the decision maker is an edge host. Both approaches have drawbacks. Edge hosts do not always have access to enough global information to create the most optimal resource allocation strategy. Central servers do but at the cost of privacy. A solution is needed that can do both. This article, therefore, presents a novel resource allocation method called concurrent federated reinforcement learning. The scheme inherits the privacy protection of federated learning, the complex problem solving power of reinforcement learning and adds concurrency in the form of joint decision making so the resource allocation strategies work to the benefit of the global system. The experiments demonstrate that the approach provides the state-of-the-art performance in system-wide utility, speed of task completion, and resource utilization.

AB In recent years, the rapid development and wide application of advanced technologies have profoundly impacted industrial manufacturing, leading to smart manufacturing (SM). However, the Industrial IoT (IIoT)-based manufacturing systems are now one of the top industries targeted by a variety of attacks. In this research, we propose detecting Cyberattacks in Industrial Control Systems using Anomaly Detection. An anomaly detection architecture for the IIoT-based SM is proposed to deploy one of the top most concerned networking technique -a Federated Learning architecture -that can detect anomalies for time series data typically running inside an industrial system. The architecture achieves higher detection performance compared to the current detection solution for time series data. It also shows the feasibility and efficiency to be deployed on top of edge computing hardware of an IIoT-based SM that can save 35% of bandwidth consumed in the transmission link between the edge and the cloud. At the expense, the architecture needs to trade off with the computing resource consumed at edge devices for implementing the detection task. However, findings in maximal CPU usage of 85% and average Memory usage of 37% make this architecture totally realizable in an IIoT-based SM. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Minimal data poisoning attack in federated learning for medical image

   budget; Attack visibility; Medical image classification
AB The privacy-sensitive nature of medical image data is often bounded by strict data sharing regulations that necessitate the need for novel modeling and analysis techniques. Federated learning (FL) enables multiple medical institutions to collectively train a deep neural network without sharing sensitive patient information. In addition, FL uses its collaborative approach to address challenges related to the scarcity and non-uniform distribution of heterogeneous medical domain data. Nevertheless, the data-opaque nature and distributed setup make FL susceptible to data poisoning attacks. There are diverse FL data poisoning attacks for classification models on natural image data in the literature. But their primary focus is on the impact of the attack and they do not consider the attack budget and attack visibility. The attack budget is essential for adversaries to optimize resource utilization in real-world scenarios, which determines the number of manipulations or perturbations they can apply. Simultaneously, attack visibility is crucial to ensure covert execution, allowing attackers to achieve their objectives without triggering detection mechanisms. Generally, an attacker's aim is to create maximum attack impact with minimal resources and low visibility. So, considering these three entities can effectively comprehend the adversary's perspective in designing an attack for real-world scenarios. Further, data poisoning attacks on medical images are challenging compared to natural images due to the subjective nature of medical data. Hence, we develop an attack with a low budget, low visibility, and high impact for medical image classification in FL. We propose a federated learning attention guided minimal attack (FL-AGMA), that uses class attention maps to identify specific medical image regions for perturbation. We introduce image distortion degree (IDD) as a metric to assess the attack budget. Also, we develop a feedback mechanism to regulate the attack coefficient for low attack visibility. Later, we optimize the attack budget by adaptively changing the IDD based on attack visibility. We extensively evaluate three large-scale datasets, namely, Covid-chestxray, Camelyon17, and HAM10000, covering three different data modalities. We observe that our FL-AGMA method has resulted in 44.49% less test accuracy with only 24% of IDD attack budget and lower attack visibility compared to the other attacks.

TI RSAM: Byzantine-Robust and Secure Model Aggregation in Federated
   Learning for Internet of Vehicles Using Private Approximate Median
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Federated learning (FL); secure aggregation; Byzantine resilience
AB In Internet-of-Vehicles (IoVs), Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly used by smart vehicles to process various sensing data. FL is a collaborative learning approach that enables vehicles to train a shared machine learning (ML) model by exchanging their local models instead of their sensitive training data in a distributed manner. Secure aggregation, as a privacy primitive for FL, aims to further protect the local models. However, existing secure aggregation methods for FL in IoVs mostly suffer from poor security against Byzantine attacks, e.g., malicious vehicles submit fake local models, which are common in IoVs and greatly degrade the accuracy of the final shared model without being detected. In this article, we propose a new secure and efficient aggregation approach, RSAM, for resisting Byzantine attacks FL in IoVs. RSAM first securely calculates an approximate median of local models of the distributed vehicles via the divide-and-conquer strategy as the aggregation model in each training round, providing the strong Byzantine robustness that is similar to the real median (a proven robust rank-based statistic) does, where median means the coordinate-wise median. Furthermore, RSAM is a single-server secure aggregation protocol that protects the vehicles' local models and training data against inside conspiracy attacks based on zero-sharing. Finally, RSAM is efficient for vehicles in IoVs, since RSAM transforms the sorting operation over the encrypted data to a small number of comparison operations over plain texts and vector-addition operations over ciphertexts, and the main building block relies on fast symmetric-key primitives. The correctness, Byzantine resilience, and privacy protection of RSAM are analyzed, and extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm that enables collaboratively learning a shared model across massive clients while keeping the training data locally. However, for many existing FL systems, clients need to frequently exchange model parameters of large data size with the remote cloud server directly via wide-area networks (WAN), leading to significant communication overhead and long transmission time. To mitigate the communication bottleneck, we resort to the hierarchical federated learning paradigm of HiFL, which reaps the benefits of mobile edge computing and combines synchronous client-edge model aggregation and asynchronous edge-cloud model aggregation together to greatly reduce the traffic volumes of WAN transmissions. Specifically, we first analyze the convergence bound of HiFL theoretically and identify the key controllable factors for model performance improvement. We then advocate an enhanced design of HiFlash by innovatively integrating deep reinforcement learning based adaptive staleness control and heterogeneity-aware client-edge association strategy to boost the system efficiency and mitigate the staleness effect without compromising model accuracy. Extensive experiments corroborate the superior performance of HiFlash in model accuracy, communication reduction, and system efficiency.

DE federated learning fairness; computational efficiency; data
   distribution; client selection; client grouping
AB Federated learning has emerged as a distributed learning paradigm by training at each client and aggregating at a parameter server. System heterogeneity hinders stragglers from responding to the server in time with huge communication costs. Although client grouping in federated learning can solve the straggler problem, the stochastic selection strategy in client grouping neglects the impact of data distribution within each group. Besides, current client grouping approaches make clients suffer unfair participation, leading to biased performances for different clients. In order to guarantee the fairness of client participation and mitigate biased local performances, we propose a federated dynamic client selection method based on data representativity (FedSDR). FedSDR clusters clients into groups correlated with their own local computational efficiency. To estimate the significance of client datasets, we design a novel data representativity evaluation scheme based on local data distribution. Furthermore, the two most representative clients in each group are selected to optimize the global model. Finally, the DYNAMIC-SELECT algorithm updates local computational efficiency and data representativity states to regroup clients after periodic average aggregation. Evaluations on real datasets show that FedSDR improves client participation by 27.4%, 37.9%, and 23.3% compared with FedAvg, TiFL, and FedSS, respectively, taking fairness into account in federated learning. In addition, FedSDR surpasses FedAvg, FedGS, and FedMS by 21.32%, 20.4%, and 6.90%, respectively, in local test accuracy variance, balancing the performance bias of the global model across clients.

AB In the healthcare field, cross-institutional collaboration can fasten medical research progress. Vertical federated learning (VFL) addresses data heterogeneity across multiple medical institutions while ensuring medical data privacy, thereby enhancing the accuracy of disease diagnoses and treatments. However, traditional VFL only benefits from aligned samples, thereby limiting its applicability due to constrained sample sizes, and a large amount of non-aligned data remains untapped, resulting in wasted data. To exert full leverage on the value of all data obtained from medical institutions, this paper proposes a federated healthcare collaborative framework based on semi-supervised representation augmentation mechanism with cross-institutional knowledge transfer (CrossKT-FRA). Specifically, the developed method comprises three steps. First, the federated representations of shared data (aligned data) among medical institutions are extracted through efficient vertical federated representation learning (FRL) methods. Second, the federated knowledge contained in federated representations and potential labels derived through recurrent learning assist local shared data representations in performing supervised augmented learning. Finally, the federated knowledge is transferred indirectly from the representation augmentation module for shared data to the unsupervised representation augmentation module for local private data (non-aligned data). The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge transfer mechanism, whether applied independently or used to enhance VFL on medical datasets. Our findings contribute to a deeper theoretical understanding of VFL, further facilitating the utilization of high- value medical data. By promoting cross-institutional and cross-disciplinary collaboration in healthcare data sharing, our study enhances the quality efficiency of medical services, thereby accelerating the development of interdisciplinary medical research.

AB This work examines a novel wireless knowledge caching framework where machine learning models (i.e., knowledge) are cached at local small cell base-stations (SBSs) to facilitate both federated training and access of the models by users. We first consider a single-SBS scenario, where the caching decision, user selection, and wireless resource allocation are jointly determined by minimizing a training error bound subject to constraints on the cache capacity, the communication and computation latency, and the energy consumption. The solution is obtained by first computing the minimum achievable training loss for each model, followed by the optimization of the binary caching variables, which reduces to a 0-1 knapsack problem. The proposed framework is then extended to the multiple-SBS scenario where the user association among SBSs is further examined. We adopt a dual-ascent method where Lagrange multipliers are introduced and updated in each iteration to regularize the dependence among user selection and association. Given the Lagrange multipliers, the caching decision, user selection, resource allocation and user association variables are optimized in turn using a block coordinate descent algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a training error bound that is lower than preference-only and random caching policies in both scenarios.

TI FedFSA: Hybrid and federated framework for functional status

AB Introduction: Patients' functional status assesses their independence in performing activities of daily living, including basic ADLs (bADL), and more complex instrumental activities (iADL). Existing studies have discovered that patients' functional status is a strong predictor of health outcomes, particularly in older adults. Depite their usefulness, much of the functional status information is stored in electronic health records (EHRs) in either semistructured or free text formats. This indicates the pressing need to leverage computational approaches such as natural language processing (NLP) to accelerate the curation of functional status information. In this study, we introduced FedFSA, a hybrid and federated NLP framework designed to extract functional status information from EHRs across multiple healthcare institutions. Methods: FedFSA consists of four major components: 1) individual sites (clients) with their private local data, 2) a rule-based information extraction (IE) framework for ADL extraction, 3) a BERT model for functional status impairment classification, and 4) a concept normalizer. The framework was implemented using the OHNLP Backbone for rule-based IE and open-source Flower and PyTorch library for federated BERT components. For gold standard data generation, we carried out corpus annotation to identify functional status-related expressions based on ICF definitions. Four healthcare institutions were included in the study. To assess FedFSA, we evaluated the performance of category- and institution-specific ADL extraction across different experimental designs. Results: ADL extraction performance ranges from an F1-score of 0.907 to 0.986 for bADL and 0.825 to 0.951 for iADL across the four healthcare sites. The performance for ADL extraction with impairment ranges from an F1score of 0.722 to 0.954 for bADL and 0.674 to 0.813 for iADL across four healthcare sites. For category-specific ADL extraction, laundry and transferring yielded relatively high performance, while dressing, medication, bathing, and continence achieved moderate-high performance. Conversely, food preparation and toileting showed low performance. Conclusion: NLP performance varied across ADL categories and healthcare sites. Federated learning using a FedFSA framework performed higher than non-federated learning for impaired ADL extraction at all healthcare sites. Our study demonstrated the potential of the federated learning framework in functional status extraction and impairment classification in EHRs, exemplifying the importance of a large-scale, multi-institutional collaborative development effort.

AB In the 5G/B5G network paradigms, intelligent medical devices known as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) have been used in the healthcare industry to monitor remote users' health status, such as elderly monitoring, injuries, stress, and patients with chronic diseases. Since IoMT devices have limited resources, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been deployed in 5G networks to enable them to offload their tasks to the nearest computational servers for processing. However, when IoMTs are far from network coverage or the computational servers at the terrestrial MEC are overloaded/emergencies occur, these devices cannot access computing services, potentially risking the lives of patients. In this context, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are considered a prominent aerial connectivity solution for healthcare systems. In this article, we propose a multiagent federated reinforcement learning (MAFRL)-based resource allocation framework for a multi-UAV-enabled healthcare system. We formulate the computation offloading and resource allocation problems as a Markov decision process game in federated learning with multiple participants. Then, we propose an MAFRL algorithm to solve the formulated problem, minimize latency and energy consumption, and ensure the quality of service. Finally, extensive simulation results on a real-world heartbeat data set prove that the proposed MAFRL algorithm significantly minimizes the cost, preserves privacy, and improves accuracy compared to the baseline learning algorithms.

AB QoS forecasting for cellular vehicular communications allows cooperative, connected and automated mobility applications to tailor their behavior to the expected communication conditions on the road. In a nutshell, vehicles may, for example, execute cooperative maneuvers if the communication quality of service is only above a certain quantitative level whereas if not they revert to the individual autonomous mode. In this paper, we propose and show empirical methods for estimating packet -based QoS metrics obtained from 5G network measurements with a direct application to vehicular applications. As many distributed vehicular applications possess strict QoS requirements, we focus here on bounding packet -based statistical QoS quantiles, specifically for latency and loss. Our approach is based on training regression neural networks in a federated learning fashion and show that it can obtain predictions on par with centralized training without the vehicles needing to transmit raw measurement data. In contrast to QoS prediction using physical layer information, we briefly discuss the embedding of such much simpler application -level service within the 5G architecture. We also validate our approach through recovering classical closed -form delay quantiles that are obtained from analytical models of simple queueing systems. We show that our approach goes beyond these simple models in that it provides quantile estimates for the complex scenario of cellular vehicle communications and under different application traffic patterns including empirical data traffic traces as well as 5G testbed measurements.

ID DRIVER DETECTION
AB Distracted driving behavior is known as a leading factor in road traffic injuries and deaths. Fortunately, rapidly developing deep learning technology has shown its potential in distracted driving detection. Nevertheless, deep learning-based solutions need to collect large amounts of driving data captured by camera sensors in the vehicle, which will cause serious privacy concerns. As a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) has achieved competitive performance in many applications recently. Inspired by this, we introduce FL into distracted driving detection tasks. However, we observe that the heterogeneous data distribution across drivers leads to significant performance degradation of the model learned in FL. To address this challenge, we propose a simple and effective federated bidirectional knowledge distillation framework, FedBiKD. Specifically, FedBiKD utilizes the knowledge from the global model in guiding local training to mitigate the issue of local deviation. Meanwhile, the consensus from the ensemble of local models is also employed to fine-tune the aggregated global model for less volatility in training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FedBiKD in distracted driving detection. The results show that FedBiKD significantly outperforms other FL algorithms in terms of accuracy, communication efficiency, convergence rate, and stability.

AB The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has a bright future with the development of smart mobile devices. Information technology is also leading changes in the healthcare industry. IoMT devices can detect patient signs and provide treatment guidance and even instant diagnoses through technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless communication. However, conventional centralized machine learning approaches are often difficult to apply within IoMT devices because of the difficulty of large-scale collection of patient data and the potential risk of privacy breaches. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based two-stage federated learning approach that allows IoMT devices to train a global model collaboratively without gathering the data to a central server. Specifically, to address the problem of poor training performance on non-independent identically distributed (non-IID) data, we design a blockchain-based data-sharing scheme that can significantly improve the model's accuracy without threatening user privacy. We also design a client selection mechanism to further improve the system's efficiency. Finally, we validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our system through simulation experiments on three popular datasets (i.e., MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10).

AB Device -to -Device (D2D) communication plays a prominent role in mobile data offloading from the cellular infrastructure (e.g., base station). This paradigm empowers user equipment to communicate with each other directly, offering an efficient resort for data communication that eliminates the need for the base station. However, significant challenges, such as interference, resource allocation, and energy efficiency, impede the performance of D2D communication. In the context of resource allocation, most of the existing work primarily focuses on game and graph theoretical models, which raises the computational complexity as the number of D2D users increases. In this article, we formulated a sum rate maximization problem, which is solved using a combinatorial scheme comprised of Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Federated Learning (FL). First, we discover the optimal CUs-D2D Groups (D2DGs) pairs by utilizing the social behavior of whales in the WOA. Only these optimal links are permitted to participate in the FL -based resource allocation, ensuring a physical layer access control. Next, we generated a dataset from the WOA-based optimal CU-D2DG links, which is employed by the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for decentralized learning. FL offers a proactive decision for resource assignment, i.e., whose CU resources will be used by the D2DG. The proposed scheme is evaluated by considering different performance parameters, such as convergence rate, statistical measure (accuracy, loss), fairness (0.72), and overall sum rate ( approximate to 25 Mbps).

AB The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) accommodates a huge number of heterogeneous devices to bring vast services under a distributed computing scenarios. Most productive services in IIoT are closely related to production control and require distributed network support with low delay. However, the resource reservation based on gross traffic prediction ignores the importance of productive services and treats them as ordinary services, so it is difficult to provide stable low delay support for large amounts of productive service requests. For many productions, unexpected communication delays are unacceptable, and the delay may lead to serious production accidents causing great losses, especially when the productive service is security related. In this article, we propose a brain-like productive service provisioning scheme with federated learning (BrainIoT) for IIoT. The BrainIoT scheme is composed of three algorithms, including industrial knowledge graph-based relation mining, federated learning-based service prediction, and globally optimized resource reservation. BrainIoT combines production information into network optimization, and utilizes the interfactory and intrafactory relations to enhance the accuracy of service prediction. The globally optimized resource reservation algorithm suitably reserves resources for predicted services considering various resources. The numerical results show that the BrainIoT scheme utilizes interfactory relation and intrafactory relation to make an accurate service prediction, which achieves 96% accuracy, and improves the quality of service.

AB Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses, and the symptoms shown by patients are different, making it difficult to diagnose in the process of clinical practice and pathological research. Although researchers hope that artificial intelligence can contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of depression, the traditional centralized machine learning methods need to aggregate patient data, and the data privacy of patients with mental illness needs to be strictly confidential, which hinders machine learning algorithms' clinical application. To solve the problem of medical data privacy with depression, in this article, we implement a study of federated learning to analyze and diagnose depression. First, we propose a general multiview federated learning framework using multisource data, which can extend any traditional machine learning model to support federated learning across different institutions or parties. Second, we employ later fusion methods to solve the problem of inconsistent time series of multiview data. Finally, we compare the federated framework with other cooperative learning frameworks in performance and discuss the related results. The experimental results show that in the case of participating in federated learning with enough participants, the prediction accuracy of depression score can reach 85.13%, which is about 15% higher than local training. When the number of participants is small and the amount of data is sufficient, the prediction accuracy of depression score can also reach 84.32%, and the improvement rate is about 9%.

AB Deep learning (DL) has been widely proposed for botnet attack detection in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, the traditional centralized DL (CDL) method cannot be used to detect the previously unknown (zero-day) botnet attack without breaching the data privacy rights of the users. In this article, we propose the federated DL (FDL) method for zero-day botnet attack detection to avoid data privacy leakage in IoT-edge devices. In this method, an optimal deep neural network (DNN) architecture is employed for network traffic classification. A model parameter server remotely coordinates the independent training of the DNN models in multiple IoT-edge devices, while the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm is used to aggregate local model updates. A global DNN model is produced after a number of communication rounds between the model parameter server and the IoT-edge devices. The zero-day botnet attack scenarios in IoT-edge devices is simulated with the Bot-IoT and N-BaIoT data sets. Experiment results show that the FDL model: 1) detects zero-day botnet attacks with high classification performance; 2) guarantees data privacy and security; 3) has low communication overhead; 4) requires low-memory space for the storage of training data; and 5) has low network latency. Therefore, the FDL method outperformed CDL, localized DL, and distributed DL methods in this application scenario.

AB In this article, we investigate random client selection in the context of horizontal federated learning (FL), whereby only a randomly selected subset of clients transmit their model updates to the server instead of yielding all clients involved. Many researchers have demonstrated that clustering-based client selection constitutes a simple yet efficacious approach to the identification of those clients possessing representative gradient information. Despite the extensive body of research on modified selection methodologies, the majority of prior work is predicated upon the assumption of consistently effective clustering. However, raw gradient-based clustering methods are subject to several challenges: 1) poor effectiveness, the raw high-dimensional gradient of a client is too complex to serve as an appropriate feature for grouping, resulting in large intra-cluster distances and 2) fluctuating effectiveness, due to inherent limitations in clustering, the effectiveness can vary significantly, leading to clusters with diverse levels of heterogeneity. In practice, suboptimal and inconsistent clustering effects can result in clusters with low intra-cluster similarity among clients. The selection of clients from such clusters may impede the overall convergence of training. In this article, we propose, a novel client selection scheme to accelerate the FL convergence by variance reduction. The main idea of is to stratify a compressed model update in order to ensure an excellent grouping effect, and at the same time reduce the cross-client variance by re-allocating the sample chance among different groups based on their diverse heterogeneity. It strikes this convergence acceleration by paying more attention to those client groups with relatively low similarity and then improving the representativeness of the selected subset as much as possible. Theoretically, we demonstrate the critical improvement of the proposed scheme in variance reduction and present equivalence conditions among different client selection methods. We also present the tighter convergence guarantee of the proposed method thanks to the variance reduction. Experimental results confirm the exceeded efficiency of our approach compared to alternatives.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the world with its diverse applications and smart connected devices. These IoT devices communicate with each other without human intervention and make life easier in many ways. However, the independence of these devices raises several significant concerns, such as security and privacy preservation due to malicious and compromised nodes within the network. Trust management has been introduced as a less computationally intensive alternative to traditional approaches such as cryptography. The proposed FedTrust approach addresses these challenges by designing a method for identifying malicious and compromised nodes using federated learning. FedTrust trains edge nodes with a provided dataset and forms a global model to predict the abnormal behavior of IoT nodes. The proposed approach utilizes a novel trust dataset consisting of 19 trust parameters from three major components: knowledge, experience, and reputation. To reduce the computational burden, FedTrust employs the concept of communities with dedicated servers to divide the dataset into smaller parts for more efficient training. The proposed approach is extensively evaluated in comparison to existing approaches in terms of accuracy, precision, and other metrics to validate its performance in IoT networks. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedTrust by achieving a higher rate of detection and prediction of malicious and compromised nodes.

A heterogeneous communication architecture is essential to facilitate col-laborative and intelligent medical analytics in the fifth generation and beyond (B5G) networks to intelligently learn and disseminate pandemic-related information and diagnostic results. However, such a technique raises privacy issues pertaining to the health data of the patients. In this paper, we envision a privacy-preserving pandemic response network using a proof-of-concept, aerial-terrestrial network system serving mobile user entities/equipment (UEs). By leveraging the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a lightweight federated learning model is proposed to collaboratively yet privately learn medical (e.g., COVID-19) symptoms with high accuracy using the data collected by individual UEs using ambient sensors and wearable devices. An asynchronous weight updating technique is introduced in federated learning to avoid redundant learning and save precious networking as well as computing resources of the UAVs/UEs. A use-case where an Artificial Intelligence (AI) -based model is employed for COVID-19 detection from radiograph images is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning framework, where multiple distributed edge Internet of Things (IoT) devices collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central server while keeping the training data distributed on the IoT devices. FL can mitigate the privacy risks and costs from data collection in traditional centralized machine learning. However, the deployment of standard FL is hindered by the expense of the communication of the gradients from the devices to the server. Hence, many gradient compression methods have been proposed to reduce the communication cost. However, the existing methods ignore the structural correlations of the gradients and, therefore, lead to a large compression loss which will decelerate the training convergence. Moreover, many of the existing compression schemes do not enable over-the-air aggregation and, hence, require huge communication resources. In this work, we propose a gradient compression scheme, named FedOComp, which leverages the correlations of the stochastic gradients in FL systems for efficient compression of the high-dimension gradients with over-the-air aggregation. The proposed design can achieve a smaller deceleration of the training convergence compared to other gradient compression methods since the compression kernel exploits the structural correlations of the gradients. It also directly enables over-the-air aggregation to save communication resources. The derived convergence analysis and simulation results further illustrate that under the same power cost, the proposed scheme has a much faster convergence rate and higher test accuracy compared to existing baselines.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK APPROACH
AB In modern Internet of Things-enhanced wind power systems, most existing data-driven fault diagnosis approaches for wind turbines (WTs) are performed under a centralized paradigm that ignores data privacy. Recently, federated learning (FL) presented a solution to enable edge WTs located at isolated sites to collaboratively learn a shared diagnosis model without accessing local privacy-sensitive data. However, the practical issues of fault label heterogeneity among edge clients and scarcity of labeled data still severely impede the generation of a satisfactory diagnosis model. To address these issues, we propose a diagnostic knowledge-based FL framework (DKFLWT) for collaborative fault diagnosis of distributed edge WTs. In our DKFLWT framework, independently learned diagnostic knowledge from each edge client, rather than model parameters in conventional FL, is uploaded to the cloud server to enrich the client-specific information visible to the server and mitigate the adverse effects on model performance caused by label heterogeneity. To enhance the overall efficiency of the framework, we develop a two-stage, single-round training mechanism, in which the cloud server serves as a universal platform that can accommodate the customized requirements of users, implying the convenient integration of semi-supervised learning to enhance the diagnosis performance in scenarios with limited labeled data. Furthermore, a spatiotemporal memory-enhanced autoencoder is designed to sufficiently exploit essential diagnostic knowledge of different fault patterns from each client. Experimental results demonstrate superior diagnosis performance of our DKFLWT framework with an improvement of more than 22.1% in accuracy and 37.2% in training efficiency against several compared methods in all seriously heterogeneous scenarios.

TI CGIR: Conditional Generative Instance Reconstruction Attacks Against

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING

DT Article
DE Data reconstruction attacks; privacy; federated learning
AB Data reconstruction attack has become an emerging privacy threat to Federal Learning (FL), inspiring a rethinking of FL's ability to protect privacy. While existing data reconstruction attacks have shown some effective performance, prior arts rely on different strong assumptions to guide the reconstruction process. In this work, we propose a novel Conditional Generative Instance Reconstruction Attack (CGIR attack) that drops all these assumptions. Specifically, we propose a batch label inference attack in non-IID FL scenarios, where multiple images can share the same labels. Based on the inferred labels, we conduct a "coarse-to-fine" image reconstruction process that provides a stable and effective data reconstruction. In addition, we equip the generator with a label condition restriction so that the contents and the labels of the reconstructed images are consistent. Our extensive evaluation results on two model architectures and five image datasets show that without the auxiliary assumptions, the CGIR attack outperforms the prior arts, even for complex datasets, deep models, and large batch sizes. Furthermore, we evaluate several existing defense methods. The experimental results suggest that pruning gradients can be used as a strategy to mitigate privacy risks in FL if a model tolerates a slight accuracy loss.

AB With the explosive growth of user data, AI applications are increasingly affecting people's lives. To tackle the problems of data privacy and network congestion, people raise their interest in the Federated Learning (FL) framework, which enables Edge Nodes (ENs) to learn a global model without data sharing. However, FL also brings some challenges, including energy consumption restrictions, EN heterogeneity, data imbalance, and so on. These problems may lead to poor convergence accuracy, slow convergence speed, and high energy consumption during FL model training. In this paper, we focus on the performance of the FL model under energy-limited training devices, heterogeneous hardware and unbalanced data, while taking into account the social relationships between the devices. We utilize the Lyapunov optimization technique to convert the original problem into an online optimization problem, and introduce two algorithms to address this online problem. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal solution to the online problem can approximate the optimal solution to the original problem. Our simulation results validate that our proposed algorithms can achieve great performance while satisfying the energy constraints and outperforms the benchmark algorithms.

AB With the explosive growth of data and wireless devices, federated learning (FL) over wireless medium has emerged as a promising technology for large-scale distributed intelligent systems. Yet, the urgent demand for ubiquitous intelligence will generate a large number of concurrent FL tasks, which may seriously aggravate the scarcity of communication resources. By exploiting the analog superposition of electromagnetic waves, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is an appealing solution to alleviate the burden of communication required by FL. However, sharing frequency-time resources in over-the-air computation inevitably brings about the problem of inter-task interference, which poses a new challenge that needs to be appropriately addressed. In this paper, we study over-the-air federated multi-task learning (OA-FMTL) over the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access (MAC) channel. We propose a novel model aggregation method for the alignment of local gradients of different devices, which alleviates the straggler problem in over-the-air computation due to the channel heterogeneity. We establish a communication-learning analysis framework for the proposed OA-FMTL scheme by considering the spatial correlation between devices, and formulate an optimization problem for the design of transceiver beamforming and device selection. To solve this problem, we develop an algorithm by using alternating optimization (AO) and fractional programming (FP), which effectively mitigates the impact of inter-task interference on the FL learning performance. We show that due to the use of the new model aggregation method, device selection is no longer essential, thereby avoiding the heavy computational burden involved in selecting active devices. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of the analysis and the superb performance of the proposed scheme.

AB The existing trajectory prediction is mainly for specific road sections, which is poor to adapt to complex and changing traffic scenarios. Meanwhile, decentralized trajectory data is hard to be fully utilized in the data silo environment. To solve data silos in the intelligent vehicle industry, introducing federated learning methods in vehicular edge computing has attracted extensive attention. But traditional federated learning still has the potential to suffer from the mining of training data in the case of model privacy leakage. In this paper, a vehicle trajectory prediction method based on federated learning and homomorphic encryption has been presented, which adopts a three-layer architecture with a vehicle cluster, edge computing server, and cloud core network. Compared with traditional centralized deep learning methods, this approach enables joint modeling of multiple parties to improve the model's generalization performance. We used a proxy re-encryption algorithm to implement key distribution and also designed an encrypted federated network algorithm FAHEFL, which uses FAHE1 homomorphic encryption to protect the privacy of the model in parameter transmission. Each local model includes a driving behavior recognition module and trajectory output module. The driving behavior recognition module uses a 1D convolutional neural network to recognize the driving behavior, then input recognition results and historical trajectories to the trajectory output module, which uses LSTM neural network to output predicted trajectories. The experiment results show that the model built with FAHEFL has no more 1% error in the driving behavior recognition module than concentrated learning, while the minimum mean square error of the trajectory prediction module increased by only 2.5%. This article also discusses the performance between FAHEFL and well-known cryptographic federation network algorithms.

AB Preparing radiology examinations for interpretation requires prefetching relevant prior examinations and implementing hanging protocols to optimally display the examination along with comparisons. Body part is a critical piece of information to facilitate both prefetching and hanging protocols, but body part information encoded using the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard is widely variable, error-prone, not granular enough, or missing altogether. This results in inappropriate examinations being prefetched or relevant examinations left behind; hanging protocol optimization suffers as well. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly when harnessing federated deep learning techniques, allow for highly accurate automatic detection of body part based on the image data within a radiological examination; this allows for much more reliable implementation of this categorization and workflow. Additionally, new avenues to further optimize examination viewing such as dynamic hanging protocol and image display can be implemented using these techniques.

TI Gradient Statistics Aware Power Control for Over-the-Air Federated

AB Federated learning (FL) is a promising technique that enables many edge devices to train a machine learning model collaboratively in wireless networks. By exploiting the superposition nature of wireless waveforms, over-the-air computation (AirComp) can accelerate model aggregation and hence facilitate communication-efficient FL. Due to channel fading, power control is crucial in AirComp. Prior works assume that the signals to be aggregated from each device, i.e., local gradients have identical statistics. In FL, however, gradient statistics vary over both training iterations and feature dimensions, and are unknown in advance. This paper studies the power control problem for over-the-air FL by taking gradient statistics into account. The goal is to minimize the aggregation error by optimizing the transmit power at each device subject to average power constraints. We obtain the optimal policy in closed form when gradient statistics are given. Notably, we show that the optimal transmit power is continuous and monotonically decreases with the squared multivariate coefficient of variation (SMCV) of gradient vectors. We then propose a method to estimate gradient statistics with negligible communication cost. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed gradient-statistics-aware power control achieves higher test accuracy than the existing schemes for a wide range of scenarios.

AB Edge Intelligence (EI) allows Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications to run at the edge, where data analysis and decision-making can be performed in real-time and close to data sources. To protect data privacy and unify data silos distributed among end devices in EI, Federated Learning (FL) is proposed for collaborative training of shared AI models across multiple devices without compromising data privacy. However, the prevailing FL approaches cannot guarantee model generalization and adaptation on heterogeneous clients. Recently, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has drawn growing awareness in EI, as it enables a productive balance between local-specific training requirements inherent in devices and global-generalized optimization objectives for satisfactory performance. However, most existing PFL methods are based on the Parameters Interaction-based Architecture (PIA) represented by FedAvg, which suffers from unaffordable communication burdens due to large-scale parameters transmission between devices and the edge server. In contrast, Logits Interaction-based Architecture (LIA) allows to update model parameters with logits transfer and gains the advantages of communication lightweight and heterogeneous on-device model allowance compared to PIA. Nevertheless, previous LIA methods attempt to achieve satisfactory performance either relying on unrealistic public datasets or increasing communication overhead for additional information transmission other than logits. To tackle this dilemma, we propose a knowledge cache-driven PFL architecture, named FedCache, which reserves a knowledge cache on the server for fetching personalized knowledge from the samples with similar hashes to each given on-device sample. During the training phase, ensemble distillation is applied to on-device models for constructive optimization with personalized knowledge transferred from the server-side knowledge cache. Empirical experiments on four datasets demonstrate that FedCache achieves comparable performance with state-of-art PFL approaches, with more than two orders of magnitude improvements in communication efficiency.

AB The expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a significant surge in data flow over edge networks, posing substantial challenges to data mining and management. While federated edge learning (FEEL) effectively accomplishes global integration and local training based on the decentralized data sets, its deployment across expansive IoT networks introduces additional challenges. The primary issues stem from managing the interaction between the communication load and learning effectiveness. The communication loads driven by recurrent data exchanges between the user equipment (UE) and central servers exacerbate network congestion and latency issues. Moreover, the learning efficacy is undermined due to the typically nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) characteristics of real-world IoT data. In this article, a novel communication-efficient hierarchical FEEL framework is proposed to tackle these challenges. Specifically, UEs are adaptively clustered according to their link conditions, geographic locations, and data distributions. Small base stations (SBSs) collect local model updates from the UEs in their clusters and communicate with a macro base station (MBS) for the global model aggregation. To jointly maximize the communication gain (in terms of reducing latency) and the learning gain (in terms of improving accuracy), a clustering and resource allocation optimization problem is formulated, and a cross entropy-based method with low computational complexity is proposed. Numerical experiments validate that the proposed hierarchical FEEL system achieves fast convergence and significantly improves the system efficiency for various learning tasks and the system settings.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Digital twin (DT) can bridge the physical status with the virtual space in real-time for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), where the integration of federated learning (FL) with DT can enable many edge intelligence services for timely intelligent production in the era of Industry 4.0. However, the issues of heterogeneity of devices and the resource-constrained IIoT make it challenging to achieve efficient FL via DT technology. To handle this problem, we propose a DT-enabled IIoT (DTENI) framework in wireless networks, in which DTs capture the characteristics of industrial devices to enable real-time processing and intelligent decision-making. Specifically, we first analyze the necessity of adaptive wireless parameters (i.e., CPU frequency, bandwidth, and transmission power) on FL training performance and provide theoretical analysis in the DTENI IIoT. Based on the above analysis, we then formulate the minimization problem of FL model loss under a given resource budget, which is a stochastic optimization problem with strongly coupled wireless parameters variables. Benefiting from the model-free learning superiority of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in dealing with stochastic optimization problems, we develop DTENI-assisted DRL to adaptively adjust the wireless parameters for solving this optimization problem. Lastly, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can mostly save communication costs up to 74.23%, 69.51%, and 60.94% compared to the three benchmarks.

AB Moving networks comprising of moving small cells (MoSCs) is an emerging technology that provide ubiquitous connectivity to the cellular users in vehicular environment. MoSCs are the small cells deployed on the top of vehicles (city buses, trains, trams etc.) to support the vehicular users with improved quality-of-service (QoS). However, the deployment of small cells in vehicular environment demands for an efficient resource allocation mechanism. This is due to high mobility of MoSCs resulting in dynamic interference between MoSCs, high computational cost, privacy issues, latency issues, and high data transmission requirement. To overcome these issues, gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based federated learning (FL) model is proposed for resource allocation in moving networks. In our proposed work, we investigate resource allocation in vehicular edge computing (VEC)enabled MoSC network with MoSCs deployed on trams travelling with deterministic mobility. In the proposed MoSC network, road side units (RSUs) equipped with VEC servers use their computational power to train the resource allocation model in a distributed manner, in which each RSU exploits the training data of its associated MoSCs to generate a shared model. The proposed GRU-based FL model enables RSUs to cooperatively train a global model that can predict resource block (RB) allocation to MoSCs without transmitting the historical data to the central server. We have conducted extensive system level simulations to determine key performance comparison between FL and centralized learning-based resource allocation in MoSC network.

   recommendation
AB With the development of the Industrial Internet of Things system, the huge amount of devices, services, and continuous data, making it difficult to discover a trusted service in complex scenarios. To better leverage knowledge and historical behavior, recommendation systems are applied. However, the model accuracy closely depends on training data size; there is a great risk of data leaking by collecting from multiple departments. To solve these problems, we propose a graph-convolutional-neural-network-based federated approach, which accurately recommends proper service for participating clients without gathering the raw data. Specifically, each client trains locally and uploads the weights of their model to the server for aggregation. Besides, the potential overlapping services of different clients are leveraged to guide the embedding aggregation and sharing, which, in turn, optimize the local training results. Their sensitive scenarios' embedding is kept locally. Owing to the model aggregation, it also resists the poisoning attack to some degree. In addition, the comprehensive experiments on classic public recommendation datasets evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, trustworthiness, and potential influences.

AB The rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) underscores the potential of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology to contribute to load peak-shaving, valley-filling, and photovoltaic (PV) self-consumption. Effective V2G control strategies can be obtained by data-driven techniques, which is able to leverage historical and current data to inform future decision-making amidst uncertainties. However, the centralized collection and sharing of data among charging stations face challenges due to data asset concerns. Furthermore, even if data sharing hurdles are overcome, the non-independent and non-identically distributed (Non-IID) nature of data across charging stations can still negatively impact performance. In this study, we introduce FedPT-V2G, a security-enhanced federated transformer learning approach for real-time V2G dispatch that addresses Non-IID data. We employ deep learning models trained on historical and current data to enable real-time decision-making, facilitating both load shifting and PV self-consumption. Additionally, we utilize federated learning to jointly train a global model across all charging stations without collecting or sharing any local private data. We pioneer the application of the Proximal algorithm and Transformer model to tackle data distribution discrepancies within the V2G scheduling prediction task. The Proximal algorithm employs regularization techniques to align local models at each charging station more closely with the global model during updates. Concurrently, the multi-head attention mechanism within the Transformer model allows learned feature vectors to diverge, enabling better exploitation of variations across the entire feature space. Finally, we validate the proposed FedPT-V2G approach through extensive numerical simulations, demonstrating comparable performance to centralized learning on both balanced (98.93% vs 98.65%) and imbalanced (92.15% vs 92.20% in label skew) datasets.

AB Communication limitation at the edge is widely recognized as a major bottleneck for federated learning (FL). Multi-hop wireless networking provides a cost-effective solution to enhance service coverage and spectrum efficiency at the edge, which could facilitate large-scale and efficient machine learning (ML) model aggregation. However, FL over multi-hop wireless networks has rarely been investigated. In this paper, we optimize FL over wireless mesh networks by taking into account the heterogeneity in communication and computing resources at mesh routers and clients. We present a framework that each intermediate router performs in-network model aggregation before sending the data to the next hop, so as to reduce the outgoing data traffic and hence aggregate more models under limited communication resources. To accelerate model training, we formulate our optimization problem by jointly considering model aggregation, routing, and spectrum allocation. Although the problem is a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming, we transform it into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), and develop a coarse-grained fixing procedure to solve it efficiently. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution approach, and the superiority of the in-network aggregation scheme over the counterpart without in-network aggregation.

AB Device-free localization (DFL) has been acknowledged as one of the most emerging technologies for consumer-electronics applications. To achieve high accuracy, many researchers have developed various neural network models to extract effective features. However, privacy protection has not received enough attentions. In existing DFL systems, user data are uploaded to a central server for processing, which carries the risk of DFL users' data privacy leakage. To fill such this gap, we propose a privacy-preserving DFL approach, named PPDFL. Under a federated learning architecture, PPDFL transfers the trained parameters instead of sending raw data to avoid data privacy leakage. Moreover, we design a convex hull optimization algorithm to optimize the model aggregation mechanism. By calculating convex hull areas of data to assign reasonable weights, the global model to obtain better solutions, which enables high inference accuracy with low data quality. Sufficient experiments based on a real testbed show that PPDFL can achieve 95%-100% accuracy in most cases, and when the data quality is poor, the global model still achieves 80%-90% accuracy, which is improved by 5%-10% compared to the widely used FedAvg algorithm.

AB Many machine learning (ML) techniques suffer from the drawback that their output (e.g., a classification decision) is not clearly and intuitively connected to their input (e.g., an image). To cope with this issue, several explainable ML techniques have been proposed to, for example, identify which pixels of an input image had the strongest influence on its classification. However, in distributed scenarios, it is often more important to connect decisions with the information used for the model training and the nodes supplying such information. To this end, in this article we focus on federated learning and present a new methodology, named node liability in federated learning (NL-FL), which permits identifying the source of the training information that most contributed to a given decision. After discussing NL-FL's cost in terms of extra computation, storage, and network latency, we demonstrate its usefulness in an edge-based scenario. We find that NL-FL is able to swiftly identify misbehaving nodes and to exclude them from the training process, thereby improving learning accuracy.

   heterogeneity
AB Federated learning (FL) is a popular collaborative distributed machine learning paradigm across mobile devices. However, practical FL over resource constrained mobile devices confronts multiple challenges, e.g., the local on-device training and model updates in FL are power hungry and radio resource intensive for mobile devices. To address these challenges, in this paper, we attempt to take FL into the design of future wireless networks and develop a novel joint design of wireless transmission and weight quantization for energy efficient FL over mobile devices. Specifically, we develop flexible weight quantization schemes to facilitate on-device local training over heterogeneous mobile devices. Based on the observation that the energy consumption of local computing is comparable to that of model updates, we formulate the energy efficient FL problem into a mixed-integer programming problem where the quantization and spectrum resource allocation strategies are jointly determined for heterogeneous mobile devices to minimize the overall FL energy consumption (computation + transmissions) while guaranteeing model performance and training latency. Since the optimization variables of the problem are strongly coupled, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed, where the bandwidth allocation and weight quantization levels are derived. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB Along with urbanization and the deployment of GPS sensors in vehicles and mobile phones, massive amounts of trajectory data have been generated for city areas. The analysis of these data has substantially contributed to research and advancements of travel time estimation. However, existing work focuses on estimating travel time inside a particular area, and cross-area travel time estimation has privacy security challenges due to data exchange issues among areas. Meanwhile, the majority of methods estimate a deterministic travel time for a given trajectory, which does not account for complex traffic situations and user requirements. To address these problems, we propose a cross-area travel time uncertainty estimation algorithm for estimating the uncertainty of travel times while preserving privacy among different areas. Specifically, we design a comprehensive cross-area privacy-preserving solution that trains a tailor-made neural network travel time estimator in each area by local data, and incorporates federated learning for training. Furthermore, we employ Bayesian deep learning principles and adopt Monte-Carlo dropout to quantify the uncertainty associated with travel time. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct a series of comprehensive case studies with two real-world trajectory datasets. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to baselines in the context of the cross-area setting.

AB Federated learning has become a popular tool in the big data era nowadays. It trains a centralized model based on data from different clients while keeping data decentralized. In this paper, we propose a federated sparse sliced inverse regression algorithm for the first time. Our method can simultaneously estimate the central dimension reduction subspace and perform variable selection in a federated setting. We transform this federated high-dimensional sparse sliced inverse regression problem into a convex optimization problem by constructing the covariance matrix safely and losslessly. We then use a linearized alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm to estimate the central subspace. We also give approaches of Bayesian information criterion and holdout validation to ascertain the dimension of the central subspace and the hyper-parameter of the algorithm. We establish an upper bound of the statistical error rate of our estimator under the heterogeneous setting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and real world applications.

TI Federated Learning With Heterogeneous Quantization Bit Allocation and
   Aggregation for Internet of Things
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL

DT Article
DE Bit allocation; federated learning (FL); heterogeneous quantization;
   Internet of Things (IoT)
AB Model quantization has drawn much attention for federated learning (FL) over the Internet of Things (IoT) since it is an effective way to address the critical bottleneck of communication efficiency. State-of-the-art studies have generally assumed homogeneous model quantization, where all clients' updates are quantized using the same number of bits and aggregated with the same weight at the server. However, in practical IoT scenarios, various IoT devices may apply heterogeneous quantization bits due to their different hardware capabilities, which leads to heterogeneous model quantization accuracy. This article addresses the problem of heterogeneous quantization bit allocation and aggregation for FL. The clients may be allocated with a different number of quantization bits, subject to a total quantization bit constraint. The server may employ different aggregation weights to each IoT device. In particular, we propose FedHBAA-FL with Heterogeneous Bit Allocation and Aggregation, a novel joint quantization bit allocation and server aggregation algorithm. In FedHBAA, we first develop an optimal server aggregation scheme under any given bit allocation among clients. By minimizing the drift term in the convergence rate analysis, a closed-form aggregation weight solution as a function of the allocated bits is obtained for both the strongly convex and nonconvex loss functions. Then, by solving the derived optimal aggregation weights, the optimal bit allocation scheme is obtained. Numerical experiments demonstrate that FedHBAA outperforms the traditional FedAVG algorithm with equal quantization bits.

AB Network traffic analysis is a key paradigm for the development of next-generation networks. Extensive deployment of network devices enables the collection of real-time traffic data for statistical analysis, thus providing timely feedback on unexpected situations that may arise. However, traditional data-driven methods fail to capture the unique properties of such data, which result in models with poor performance, low efficiency, and potential privacy risks. Though much of the pertinent work has focused on the federated learning as the alternative, the heterogeneity of both data distributions and arrival patterns have not been taken into account. We therefore define the dual heterogeneity challenge and conduct extensive experiments to explore the impact of the challenge on existing optimization algorithms. Subsequently, to address the challenge, we propose H_strSAGA in local optimization stage and develop a federated learning framework FedStream, where the various computing capabilities and communication bandwidths are considered by sequencing devices during the aggregation process. Furthermore, as the heterogeneity among devices increases, synchronous training may face potential challenge with stragglers, we additionally incorporate an asynchronous aggregation algorithm. Experimental studies using real-world datasets have demonstrated significant improvement on the convergence of the global model and the performance of model generalization.

AB This article considers the scenario where multiple Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices collaborate to train a distributed model using federated learning (FL). Wireless power transfer (WPT) is employed to address the issue of limited battery life of IoT devices, while nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is utilized to facilitate data transmission. Besides, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is applied to assist both energy transfer and data transmission. On this basis, a joint resource allocation problem is formulated to minimize the total energy consumption for the considered IRS-aided FL-WPT networks with NOMA. The nonconvex problem is first solved by developing a combination of semi-definite programming relaxation (SDR) with a two-dimensional search algorithm. To lower the computational complexity, SDR with a bisection algorithm is further employed by exploiting the inherent structure of the formulated problem. Numerical results not only validate the equivalence of these two algorithms in performance but also unequivocally establish the superior efficiency of the proposed method over benchmark schemes in terms of energy consumption.

AB Traffic flow prediction (TFP) plays a key role in optimizing intelligent transportation systems and reducing congestion in smart cities. However, current centralized TFP systems suffer from several limitations: limited adaptability to localized traffic patterns, privacy concerns associated with sharing raw data, inability to provide real-time predictions, network inefficiency due to large data transmissions, and difficulties in handling heterogeneous traffic environments. FedGODE (Federated Graph Ordinary Differential Equations) model offers comprehensive solution to these issues. By employing federated learning (FL), FedGODE enables Roadside -Units (local clients) to contribute to the model training process, addressing challenges of localized traffic patterns and ensuring a more accurate representation of diverse scenarios. FedGODE incorporates privacy -preserving mechanisms (local differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and secure aggregation), mitigating privacy concerns. FedGODE facilitates real-time updates to the global model, ensuring adaptability to dynamic traffic conditions while reducing network inefficiencies by transmitting only model updates. FedGODE utilizes (average/median) aggregation methods to aggregate the client's local updates. The performance of FedGODE was evaluated using six real -world traffic flow datasets and compared against nine baselines (ARIMA, VAR, FC-LSTM, STGCN, DCRNN, ASTGCN, Graph WaveNet, STG2seq, STGODE, and FedGRU). The results showed that FedGODE outperforms all baselines for short -and -long-term prediction. This approach makes FedGODE an effective solution for TFP scenarios, particularly in environments with heterogeneous traffic dynamics and privacy considerations.

AB The lack of complete labels and data heterogeneity are obstacles to the application of artificial intelligence-based methods in industrial scenarios, such as machinery fault diagnosis. To address these challenges, this article proposes a federated learning (FL) framework for the industrial Internet of Things based on bidirectional knowledge distillation (KD) and hard sample selection. In the framework, the cloud server provides a pretrained deep learning (DL) model based on the cross-domain public dataset to facilitate the cold start in real-world applications. Then during the training process, each participating factory trains its heterogeneous local DL model according to local data volume and computing resources. Bidirectional KD with feature maps and hard sample selection is then carried out on a shared dataset between the server and factories to share knowledge efficiently. Moreover, all the DL models used in the application of the proposed framework are designed based on expertise and attention mechanism to diagnose multiple types of machinery and faults. Case studies using the vibration data collected from multiple factories show that the proposed framework improves the fault diagnosis accuracy compared to other FL methods while significantly reducing communication overhead.

AB Traffic sign recognition and autonomous vehicles computing are a few of the innovative applications which are emerging in the domain of mobile edge computing. Distributed machine learning in the form of Federated Learning (FL) has been applied to mobile edge computing through a range of methodologies and techniques for intelligent feature classification approaches. The challenges that research on such FL methods is facing is twofold: identify an optimal distributed architecture and algorithm components to each side to meet the demand of heavy data processing, and enhance the algorithm components with heuristics that fit to the problem domain and optimize the key parameters of the algorithms. In this prospect, we present a Federated Learning implementation based on a neural network architecture with emphasis to traffic sign image recognition. Our benchmark was tested with two FL strategies seeking an optimal performance model and in reference to a corresponding data set. We present the results of this work while we define the scope of future improvements to our model.

AB Accurate identification of driver's drowsiness state through Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can effectively reduce traffic accidents, but EEG signals are usually stored in various clients in the form of small samples. This study attempts to construct an efficient and accurate privacy-preserving drowsiness monitoring system, and proposes a fusion model based on tree Federated Learning (FL) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which can not only identify and explain the driver's drowsiness state, but also integrate the information of different clients under the premise of privacy protection. Each client uses CNN with the Global Average Pooling (GAP) layer and shares model parameters. The tree FL transforms communication relationships into a graph structure, and model parameters are transmitted in parallel along connected branches of the graph. Moreover, the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) is used to find distinctive EEG features for representing specific classes. On EEG data of 11 subjects, it is found that this method has higher average accuracy, F1-score and AUC than the traditional classification method, reaching 73.56%, 73.26% and 78.23%, respectively. Compared with the traditional FL algorithm, this method better protects the driver's privacy and improves communication efficiency.

AB The multi-site approach has attracted increasing attention in brain disease diagnosis, because it can improve the prediction performance by integrating sample information from different medical institutions. However, its training procedure requires the transmission of subject's original images or features among sites, which may cause privacy disclosure. In this article, we propose a self-supervised federated adaptation (S2FA) framework for robust multi-site prediction, which can reduce the risk of privacy disclosure. As far as we know, it is the first work to investigate the cross-site brain disease diagnosis, which trains model on source sites and tests on target site, often occurring in clinical practice. First, we implement a decentralized federated optimization strategy, by which each site communicates model parameters periodically. Second, we construct an auxiliary self-supervised model for target site through transferring knowledge from source sites with self-paced learning. Then, a hash mapping is proposed to encode the target feature, simultaneously reducing the risk of privacy information disclosure and alleviating data heterogeneity among sites. Finally, we achieve the cross-site prediction by weighted federated source model and auxiliary target model. Experimental results on multi-site datasets show that the proposed S2FA can accurately identify brain disease. Our codes are available at https://github.com/nuaayqm/S2FA.

TI Federated Learning Based on OPTICS Clustering Optimization
SO DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB Federated learning (FL) has emerged for solving the problem of data fragmentation and isolation in machine learning based on privacy protection. Each client node uploads the trained model parameter information to the central server based on the local training data, and the central server aggregates the parameter information to achieve the purpose of common training. In the real environment, the distribution of data among nodes is often inconsistent. By analyzing the influence of independent identically distributed data (non-IID) on the accuracy of FL, it is shown that the accuracy of the model obtained by the traditional FL method is low. Therefore, we proposed the diversified sampling strategies to simulate the non-IID data situation and came up with the OPTICS (ordering points to identify the clustering structure)-based clustering optimization federated learning method (OCFL), which solves the problem that the learning accuracy is reduced when the data of different nodes are non-IID in FL. Experiments indicate that OCFL greatly improves the model accuracy and training speed compared with the traditional FL algorithm.

AB Federated learning (FL) in a bandwidth-limited network with energy-limited user equipments (UEs) is under-explored. In this article, to jointly save energy consumed by the battery-limited UEs and accelerate the convergence of the global model in FL for the bandwidth-limited network, we propose the sliding differential evolution-based scheduling (SDES) policy. To this end, we first formulate an optimization that aims to minimize a weighted sum of energy consumption and model training convergence. Then, we apply the SDES with parallel differential evolution (DE) operations in several small-scale windows, to address the above proposed problem effectively. Compared with existing scheduling policies, the proposed SDES performs well in reducing energy consumption and the model convergence with lower computational complexity.

AB Under the times of the Industrial Internet of Things, the traditional centralized machine learning management method cannot deal with such huge data streams, and the problem of data privacy has aroused widespread concern. In view of these difficulties, in this article, we use the advantages of edge computing and federated learning, combined with the outstanding characteristics of the blockchain, to propose a secure data transmission method. First, we separate the local model updating process from the mobile device independent process; second, we add an edge server so that most of the computation is carried out on the server, which improves the learning efficiency; and finally, we use a distributed architecture of the blockchain to protect data security and privacy. Extensive simulation experiments show that the accuracy of our model can reach 98%. In addition, BC-EdgeFLs interception rate of illegal information can reach 0.8, which has good defensive capabilities. Therefore, the security of data transmission can be strongly guaranteed.

ID RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM; SIMILARITY
AB Friendships are the keystone of social networks. Predicting potential friendships of users in social networks has become a critical task in the real world. However, the computational models proposed by previous researchers do not effectively capture the behavior preferences of users, which limits the recommendation results. Moreover, the process of generating predicted values has not considered the cross-information among different features. Therefore, we design a potential friendship prediction model based on graph convolutional autoencoder and factorization machine (GCAFM). The GCAFM model uses a graph convolutional autoencoder to learn the hidden feature of users, which can make the similar users as close as possible in the embedding space. The hidden feature of the target users is then subjected to an element-to-element multiplication operation, and the product results are subsequently inputting into a factorization machine model that capable of feature crossover to get the predicted friendship. In addition, we use the federated learning framework to train the GCAFM model, which ensures the privacy of social network data. The experimental results on Douban and FilmTrust social network datasets show that the GCAFM model exceeds four comparison models under various kinds of evaluation metrics. The GCAFM model scored 0.856 and 0.850 under the AUC metric, 0.683 and 0.702 under the AUPR metric, 0.805 and 0.844 under the Precision metric on Douban and FilmTrust datasets.

AB Emerging technologies, such as mobile-edge computing (MEC) and next-generation communications are crucial for enabling rapid development and deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). With the increasing scale of IoT networks, how to optimize the network and allocate the limited resources to provide high-quality services remains a major concern. The existing work in this direction mainly relies on models that are of less practical value for resource-limited IoT networks, and can hardly simulate the dynamic systems in real time. In this article, we integrate digital twins with edge networks and propose the digital twin edge networks (DITENs) to fill the gap between physical edge networks and digital systems. Then, we propose a blockchain-empowered federated learning scheme to strengthen communication security and data privacy protection in DITEN. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of the integrated scheme, we propose an asynchronous aggregation scheme and use digital twin empowered reinforcement learning to schedule relaying users and allocate spectrum resources. Theoretical analysis and numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme can considerably enhance both communication efficiency and data security for IoT applications.

TI Selective Trimmed Average: A Resilient Federated Learning Algorithm With

DT Article
DE Adversarial attacks; distributed optimization; multiagent systems;
   resilient federated learning (FL)
ID STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT; DISTRIBUTED OPTIMIZATION; CONSENSUS
AB The federated learning (FL) paradigm aims to distribute the computational burden of the training process among several computation units, usually called agents or workers, while preserving private local training datasets. This is generally achieved by resorting to a server-worker architecture where agents iteratively update local models and communicate local parameters to a server that aggregates and returns them to the agents. However, the presence of adversarial agents, which may intentionally exchange malicious parameters or may have corrupted local datasets, can jeopardize the FL process. Therefore, we propose selective trimmed average (SETA), which is a resilient algorithm to cope with the undesirable effects of a number of misbehaving agents in the global model. SETA is based on properly filtering and combining the exchanged parameters. We mathematically prove that the proposed algorithm is resilient against data and local model poisoning attacks. Most resilient methods presented so far in the literature assume that a trusted server is in hand. In contrast, our algorithm works both in server-worker and shared memory architectures, where the latter excludes the necessity of a trusted server. The theoretical findings are corroborated through numerical results on MNIST dataset and on multiclass weather dataset (MWD).

AB Humankind's urbanization and luxuriousneed increase the number of vehicles day by day. Alongside the advancement of technologies, autonomous vehicles have now come into a greater existence. Due to the resource constraints for obtaining a high processing rate in performing the intelligent tasks, Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has been introduced. However, a delay occurs in transferring the information due to the traits of automotive tasks. In this paper, a Federated Learning empowered computation Offloading and Resource management (FLOR) is proposed, which offloads and manages the resources with low latency. The FLOR framework operates over heterogeneous networks that include Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), 5G millimeter-wave (5G-mmWave), and 6G Vehicle-to-Vehicle (6G-V2V) communication. FLOR employs the stochastic network calculus mechanism for computing the upper bound delay of the heterogeneous communication and obtains the probability of offloading mechanism. Upon the detected probability value, the FLOR offloads the computation task to the optimal network. Further, to avoid the increase in resource cost and utilize the available resources efficiently, an effective Radio Resource Management (e-RRM) based on Federated Q-Learning is proposed in FLOR, for allocating and using the available resources optimally. The simulation result shows that the proposed FLOR framework effectively offloads the computation between the available heterogeneous networks with optimal resource allocation by 20.69% than the existing solutions.

AB Supported by some of the major revolutionary technologies, such as Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), Edge Computing, and Machine Learning (ML), the traditional Vehicular Networks (VNs) are changing drastically and converging rapidly into one of the most complex, highly intelligent, and advanced networking systems, mostly known as Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Recently, distributed ML techniques, such as Federated Learning (FL) have gained huge popularity mainly for their advantages in terms of intelligence sharing and privacy concerns. VNs are a natural contender for exploiting FL for solving challenging problems; however, their limited resources, dynamic nature, high speed, and reduced latency requirements often become the bottleneck. V2X communication technologies allow vehicular terminals (VTs) to share their valuable local environment parameters and become aware of their surroundings. Such information can be utilized to build a more sustainable and affordable FL platform for serving VTs. Gaining from recently introduced 3D architectures, integrating terrestrial and aerial edge computing layers, we present here a distributed FL platform able to distribute the FL process on a 3D fashion while reducing the overall communication cost for providing vehicular services. The framework is defined as a constrained optimization problem for reducing the overall FL process cost through a proper network selection between various nodes. We have modeled the FL network selection problem as a sequential decision-making process through a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with time-dependent state transition probabilities. A computation-efficient value iteration algorithm is adapted for solving the MDP. Comparison with various benchmark methods shows the overall improvement in terms of latency, energy, and FL performance.

AB Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD) significantly impacts global cancer mortality rates. Recent strides in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have primarily harnessed imaging techniques like CT, X-rays, PET, and MRI for cancer detection. Concurrently, the rapidly growing volume of genomic big data presents an untapped reservoir for identifying genetic mutations characteristic of STAD. Our research explores this avenue by examining gene amino acid sequences altered by STAD. We employ physical properties of amino acids, i.e., Electro-Ion Interaction Pseudopotential (EIIP) values and Kidera factors in feature extraction, a novel strategy in STAD diagnostics. To address the issue of class imbalance, we incorporate generative AI to produce additional data samples. Addressing the privacy and security challenges associated with data centralization in healthcare, we propose Fed_ANN11, an artificial neural network (ANN) model developed in a federated environment following an initial deployment as ANN11. Our model demonstrates remarkable accuracy in both simple and federated environments with extracted feature sets, namely, EIIP-based and Kidera factors-based. We found that EIIP-based features eclipse Kidera factors in performance. In a simple setting, the proposed model achieved a testing accuracy of 86% and a training accuracy of 88% for STAD detection using the EIIP-based feature set. In a federated environment, it achieved an accuracy of 0.94% in testing and 0.99% in training for STAD detection using the EIIP-based feature set. Moreover, our proposed model shows significant performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Fed_ANN11 not only excels in diagnostic precision but also upholds stringent big data security and privacy protocols, heralding a paradigm shift in AI's role in healthcare.

AB Federated learning (FL) allows clients at the edge to learn a shared global model without disclosing their private data. However, FL is susceptible to poisoning attacks, wherein an adversary injects tainted local models that ultimately corrupt the global model. Despite various defensive mechanisms having been developed to combat poisoning attacks, they all fall short of securing practical FL scenarios with heterogeneous and unbalanced data distribution. Moreover, the cutting-edge defenses currently at our disposal demand access to a proprietary dataset that closely mirrors the distribution of clients' data, which runs counter to the fundamental principle of privacy protection in FL. It is still challenging to devise an effective defense approach that applies to practical FL. In this work, we strive to narrow the divide between FL defense and its practical use. We first present a general framework to comprehend the effect of poisoning attacks in FL when the training data is not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). We then present HeteroFL, a novel FL scheme that incorporates four complementary defensive strategies. These tactics are implemented in succession to refine the aggregated model toward approaching the global optimum. Ultimately, we devise an adaptive attack specifically for HeteroFL, aimed at offering a more thorough evaluation of its robustness. Our extensive experiments over heterogeneous datasets and models show that HeteroFL surpasses all state-of-the-art defenses in thwarting various poisoning attacks, i.e., HeteroFL achieves global model accuracies comparable to the baseline, whereas other defenses suffer a significant accuracy reduction ranging from 34% to 79%.

AB Federated learning (FL) framework enables user devices to collaboratively train a global model based on their local data sets without privacy leak. However, the training performance of FL is degraded when the data distributions of different devices are incongruent. Fueled by this issue, we consider a clustered FL (CFL) method where the devices are divided into several clusters according to their data distributions and are trained simultaneously. Convergence analysis is conducted, which shows that the clustered model performance depends on cosine similarity, device number per cluster, and device participation probability. Besides, to quantify the training performance, the utility of clustered model training is defined based on the analysis results. Then, aiming at optimizing the system utility, a joint problem of resource allocation and device clustering is formulated, which is solved by decoupling it into two subproblems. First, given the results of device clustering, a low-complexity iterative algorithm based on the convex optimization theory is proposed to make the bandwidth allocation and the transmit power control. Then, according to the individual stability, a coalition formation algorithm is proposed for the device clustering. Finally, the real-data experiments on the classification tasks (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) validate the results of convergence analysis and advantages of the proposed algorithm in terms of the test accuracy.

AB Background: Deep learning-based segmentation algorithms usually required large or multi-institute data sets to improve the performance and ability of generalization. However, protecting patient privacy is a key concern in the multi-institutional studies when conventional centralized learning (CL) is used.Purpose: To explores the feasibility of a proposed lesion delineation for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) scheme for federated learning (FL), which can solve decentralization and privacy protection concerns.Study Type: Retrospective.Subjects: 506 and 118 vestibular schwannoma patients aged 15-88 and 22-85 from two institutes, respectively; 1069 and 256 meningioma patients aged 12-91 and 23-85, respectively; 574 and 705 brain metastasis patients aged 26-92 and 28-89, respectively.Field Strength/Sequence: 5T, spin-echo, and gradient-echo.Assessment: The proposed lesion delineation method was integrated into an FL framework, and CL models were established as the baseline. The effect of image standardization strategies was also explored. The dice coefficient was used to evaluate the segmentation between the predicted delineation and the ground truth, which was manual delineated by neurosurgeons and a neuroradiologist.Statistical Tests: The paired t-test was applied to compare the mean for the evaluated dice scores (p < 0.05).Results: FL performed the comparable mean dice coefficient to CL for the testing set of Taipei Veterans General Hospital regardless of standardization and parameter; for the Taichung Veterans General Hospital data, CL significantly (p < 0.05) outperformed FL while using bi-parameter, but comparable results while using single-parameter. For the non-SRS data, FL achieved the comparable applicability to CL with mean dice 0.78 versus 0.78 (without standardization), and outperformed to the baseline models of two institutes.Data Conclusion: The proposed lesion delineation successfully implemented into an FL framework. The FL models were applicable on SRS data of each participating institute, and the FL exhibited comparable mean dice coefficient to CL on non-SRS dataset. Standardization strategies would be recommended when FL is used.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) anomaly detection is significant due to its fundamental roles of securing modern critical infrastructures, such as falsified data injection detection and transmission line faults diagnostic in smart grids. Researchers have proposed various detection methods fostered by machine learning (ML) techniques. Federated learning (FL), as a promising distributed ML paradigm, has been employed recently to improve detection performance due to its advantages of privacy-preserving and lower latency. However, existing FL-based methods still suffer from efficiency, robustness, and security challenges. To address these problems, in this article, we initially introduce a blockchain-empowered decentralized and asynchronous FL framework for anomaly detection in IoT systems, which ensures data integrity and prevents single-point failure while improving the efficiency. Further, we design an improved differentially private FL based on generative adversarial nets, aiming to optimize data utility throughout the training process. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first system to employ a decentralized FL approach with privacy-preserving for IoT anomaly detection. Simulation results on the real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance from aspects of robustness, accuracy, and fast convergence while maintaining high level of privacy and security protection.

AB Federated learning (FL) enables distributed clients to collectively train a global model without revealing their private data, and for efficiency clients synchronize their gradients periodically. However, this can lead to the inaccuracy in model convergence due to inconsistent data distributions among clients. In this work, we find that there is a strong correlation between FL accuracy loss and the synchronization frequency, and seek to fine tune the synchronization frequency at training runtime to make FL accurate and also efficient. Specifically, aware that under the FL privacy requirement only gradients can be utilized for making frequency tuning decisions, we propose a novel metric called gradient consistency, which can effectively reflect the training status despite the instability of realistic FL scenarios. We further devise a feedback-driven algorithm called Gradient-Instructed Frequency Tuning (GIFT), which adaptively increases or decreases the synchronization frequency based on the gradient consistency metric. We have implemented GIFT in PyTorch, and large-scale evaluations show that it can improve FL accuracy by up to 10.7% with a time reduction of 58.1%.

AB Distributed surveillance systems have the ability to detect, track, and snapshot objects moving around in a certain space. The systems generate video data from multiple personal devices or street cameras. Intelligent video-analysis models are needed to learn dynamic representation of the objects for detection and tracking. Can we exploit the structural and dynamic information without storing the spatiotemporal video data at a central server that leads to a violation of user privacy? In this work, we introduce Federated Dynamic Graph Neural Network (Feddy), a distributed and secured framework to learn the object representations from graph sequences: (1) It aggregates structural information from nearby objects in the current graph as well as dynamic information from those in the previous graph. It uses a self-supervised loss of predicting the trajectories of objects. (2) It is trained in a federated learning manner. The centrally located server sends the model to user devices. Local models on the respective user devices learn and periodically send their learning to the central server without ever exposing the user's data to server. (3) Studies showed that the aggregated parameters could be inspected though decrypted when broadcast to clients for model synchronizing, after the server performed a weighted average. We design an appropriate aggregation mechanism of secure aggregation primitives that can protect the security and privacy in federated learning with scalability. Experiments on four video camera datasets as well as simulation demonstrate that Feddy achieves great effectiveness and security.

AB In the past decade, the Artificial Intelligent & Internet of Things (AIoT) has become the disruptive force reshaping our lives and works. Billions of AIoT devices around the world are now connected to the Internet. This widespread deployment of AIoT devices presents huge challenges for the centralized AI training architecture (e.g., security issues, privacy issues). Recently, with the advance of federated learning (FL) technology, the integration of AIoT and FL is considered as a promising solution. FL enables distributed devices to collaboratively train a shared AI model while keeping all the training data contained in local. However, unlike the centralized architecture, the distributed learners are independent, uncontrollable, and self-interested. Designing effective incentive schemes to stimulate the distributed devices to actively participate in training tasks and contribute high-quality training models is the priority question. In this paper, we design a double auction mechanism for FL service market, where the trained models can be automatically traded between AIoT devices and FL platforms. Then, we propose an iterative double auction (IDA) algorithm, where a controller is implemented to guide participants to adjust their policies for the sake of maximizing individual participates utilities as well as social welfare. In addition, we propose a reinforcement learning-based scheme, termed as the Experience Weighted Attraction Learning-Double Auction (EWA-DA) algorithm. In EWA-DA, the participants can learn to improve their strategies directly by participating in the auction continuously, without the controller participating.

AB Federated Learning (FL) has empowered advancements in machine learning by using model sharing as an alternative to data sharing. This feature avoids uploading huge amounts of continuous data streams onto a central server thus reducing the need for high storage capacity of a central server. However, classical FL relies on a single central server for global model aggregation, which causes resource bottlenecks and poor client performance. Moreover, FL often deals with heterogeneous and non-IID data, which requires careful hyperparameter tuning. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel FL framework that leverages fog nodes and the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to address the challenges of single-point failure, communication efficiency, and client-side hyperparameter optimization. We use fog nodes as intermediate aggregators between the clients and the central server and apply the GA at the fog level to optimize the hyperparameters for each client. Fog nodes reduce the communication overhead and increase the robustness of the FL framework, while GA exploits the exploration and exploitation trade-off to find the optimal hyperparameters. Empirical results, obtained on real-time datasets demonstrate that adopting the proposed framework significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art versions of the FL framework.

AB Federated learning (FL) is widely used in the Internet of Things (IoT) systems. However, FL is susceptible to backdoor attacks due to its inherently distributed and privacy-preserving nature. Existing studies assume that backdoor triggers on different malicious clients are universal, and most defense algorithms are designed to counter backdoor attacks based on this assumption. Recently, dynamic backdoor attacks have been proposed to undermine robust algorithms in centralized machine learning. We introduce dynamic backdoor attacks into the FL system and develop three types of dynamic backdoors named Aggregation, Single, and Continuous to target the FL system. To defend against such attacks, we propose a novel robust algorithm called MITDBA, which utilizes gramian information to capture high-order representations, then employs spectral signatures to detect and remove malicious clients, and finally utilizes clipping operations to filter the selected local models during the aggregation process. We conduct attack and defense experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and GTSRB data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that our designed attack strategies can successfully insert dynamic backdoors into the global model, bypassing the existing state-of-the-art defenses, but these attacks can be effectively mitigated by MITDBA.

AB Domain generalization (DG) methods have been successfully proposed to enhance the generalization ability of the intelligent diagnosis model. However, these methods hardly achieve data privacy -preserving generalization diagnosis tasks due to potential conflicts of interest or data privacy protocol. To this end, this study proposes a novel federated adversarial DG network for machinery fault diagnosis. The collaborative training between the central server and several clients is implemented in the proposed network, which aims to build a global fault diagnosis model for multiple clients under data privacy conditions. To eliminate the distribution discrepancies of different clients, a multiclient feature alignment module with adversarial learning is designed. In this module, the generative adversarial network with class-wise information is introduced to generate a reference distribution adaptatively, and the adversarial training strategy between reference distribution and real distribution is implemented to learn the DG features from different clients. Experimental results on three cases show that the proposed network can achieve more than 10% performance improvement for diagnosis methods with federated learning. The small performance gap between the proposed network and the no-federated learning method suggests that the proposed network is promising for solving data privacy-preserving generalization diagnosis tasks.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the distributed machine learning field, federated learning (FL) serves as a highly effective framework for dismantling data silos and integrating data from multiple sources. However, the flourishing of FL still encounters significant challenges, particularly in the realms of data security and information privacy. In recent years, plenty of privacy-preserving FL schemes have been proposed, yet few of them support global model confidentiality protection for the training server. In this paper, by combining Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and homomorphic encryption, we propose a TEE-assisted federated logistic regression training scheme with model confidentiality protection, named TFLR. Specifically, we first formalize a cryptography-TEE hybrid security model under the multi-party cooperative computation scenario. Subsequently, within this hybrid security model, we design a series of secure computation protocols with semi-honest TEE to execute nonlinear operations while maintaining the encryption form of global model parameters. Therefore, the global model of the training server can be well protected. In addition, TFLR incorporates a double masking technique, further fortifying the privacy of data owners' local updates. Detailed security analysis shows that TFLR is able to protect all sensitive information of data owners and the training server. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of TFLR with real machine learning datasets, and the results substantiate that TFLR is indeed efficient.

AB Robust machine learning (ML) models can be developed by leveraging large volumes of data and distributing the computational tasks across numerous devices or servers. Federated learning (FL) is a technique in the realm of ML that facilitates this goal by utilizing cloud infrastructure to enable collaborative model training among a network of decentralized devices. Beyond distributing the computational load, FL targets the resolution of privacy issues and the reduction of communication costs simultaneously. To protect user privacy, FL requires users to send model updates rather than transmitting large quantities of raw and potentially confidential data. Specifically, individuals train ML models locally using their own data and then upload the results in the form of weights and gradients to the cloud for aggregation into the global model. This strategy is also advantageous in environments with limited bandwidth or high communication costs, as it prevents the transmission of large data volumes. With the increasing volume of data and rising privacy concerns, alongside the emergence of large-scale ML models like Large Language Models (LLMs), FL presents itself as a timely and relevant solution. It is therefore essential to review current FL algorithms to guide future research that meets the rapidly evolving ML demands. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis and comparison of the most recent FL algorithms, evaluating them on various fronts including mathematical frameworks, privacy protection, resource allocation, and applications. Beyond summarizing existing FL methods, this survey identifies potential gaps, open areas, and future challenges based on the performance reports and algorithms used in recent studies. This survey enables researchers to readily identify existing limitations in the FL field for further exploration.

AB With growing concern on data privacy, traditional Recommendation System (RS) raises the risk of privacy disclosure since it needs to collect a large amount of personal data. To tackle this problem, implementing RS in a federated learning (FL) manner is proposed as an efficient approach. Although various solutions have been proposed to improve privacy of federated RS models, related works ignore the communication efficiency. Moreover, most of related works merely consider one server to coordination with all users, which might not suitable for large-scale networks. To protect privacy and reduce communication overhead, we propose a privacy-preserving hierarchical federated collaborative filtering scheme for the RS. Finally, we provide the simulation results to evaluate our proposed scheme, which show that our scheme can maintain good recommendation accuracy, preserve data privacy and reduce communication overhead.

AB Over speeding of vehicles is considered one of the most important factors for occurring road accidents. An advanced sensor technology motivates the researchers to move toward automatic vehicles, whereas speed decisions were taken based on the information collected from the sensor. Beyond its success, the expensiveness, and implementation failure in bad road conditions make it less practicable. In this work, a novel federated unsupervised learning-based predictive model (FeduLPM) technique has been proposed for controlling the speed in customizable automotive variants using data analysis from the location of the accident. Instead of sharing the whole accident data on a Heroku server to train the model, a pre-trained random forest algorithm is designed on each nearby location and the accident data is updated on the local model. Attributes such as weather, automotive variants, time, location, and zone geometry are taken for providing an exact speed limit. Finally, trained parameters of the local model are aggregated; then a global model is generated and distributed to local clients without sharing local data. The experimental setup is implemented using a Python-based machine learning (ML) algorithm that draws information from the vehicle based on the gathered attributes. The proposed FeduLPM achieved 96.7% of accuracy while processing with the different locations of Bengaluru city. From the experimental results, the proposed FeduLPM is a better assistant to bike and car drivers by providing an optimum solution to prevent accidents.

AB Benefiting from the powerful data analysis and prediction capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI), the data on the edge is often transferred to the cloud center for centralized training to obtain an accurate model. To resist the risk of privacy leakage due to frequent data transmission between the edge and the cloud, federated learning (FL) is engaged in the edge paradigm, uploading the model updated on the edge server (ES) to the central server for aggregation, instead of transferring data directly. However, the adversarial ES can infer the update of other ESs from the aggregated model and the update may still expose some characteristics of data of other ESs. Besides, there is a certain probability that the entire aggregation is disrupted by the adversarial ESs through uploading a malicious update. In this article, a privacy-preserving FL scheme with robust aggregation in edge computing is proposed, named FL-RAEC. First, the hybrid privacy-preserving mechanism is constructed to preserve the integrity and privacy of the data uploaded by the ESs. For the robust model aggregation, a phased aggregation strategy is proposed. Specifically, anomaly detection based on autoencoder is performed while some ESs are selected for anonymous trust verification at the beginning. In the next stage, via multiple rounds of random verification, the trust score of each ES is assessed to identify the malicious participants. Eventually, FL-RAEC is evaluated in detail, depicting that FL-RAEC has strong robustness and high accuracy under different attacks.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for preserving user privacy in Internet of Things (IoT) networks thanks to its distributed computing feature. Furthermore, over-the-air FL (AirFL) can leverage the superposition property of wireless channels to achieve fast model aggregation through concurrent analog transmissions. To make AirFL sustainable for energy-constrained IoT devices, we apply simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) at the base station to broadcast the global model and charge local devices during the model training process. To characterize the optimality gap between the aggregated FL model and the ideal FL model brought by signal misalignment, channel fading, and random noise in the model distribution and aggregation processes, we prove the convergence of SWIPT-based AirFL to show the precise impact of up- and down-link communications on the learning performance. We formulate a long-term energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem and propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with a collaborative double-agent approach to optimize resource allocation strategies while guaranteeing learning performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve a maximum of 41% improvement in EE under various network settings compared with benchmark schemes, and the learning performance of SWIPT-based AirFL can be improved significantly by alleviating transmission errors.

AB In the domain of Graph Federated Learning (GFL), prevalent methods often focus on local client data, which can limit the understanding of broader global patterns and pose challenges with Non-IID (Non-Independent and Identically Distributed) issues in cross-domain datasets. Direct aggregation can lead to a reduction in the differences among various clients, which is detrimental to personalized datasets. Contrastive Learning (CL) has emerged as an effective tool for enhancing a model's ability to distinguish variations across diverse views but has not been fully leveraged in GFL. This study introduces a novel hypernetwork-based method, termed CCL (Centralized Contrastive Learning), which is a server-centric innovation that effectively addresses the challenges posed by traditional client-centric approaches in heterogeneous datasets. CCL integrates global patterns from multiple clients, capturing a wider range of patterns and significantly improving GFL performance. Our extensive experiments, including both supervised and unsupervised scenarios, demonstrate CCL's superiority over existing models, its remarkable compatibility with standard backbones, and its ability to enhance GFL performance across various settings.

AB "Safety is our friend, accidents our enemy" is the propaganda social information on traffic safety in several countries. This proves that safety is a top priority when using vehicles when participating in traffic. There have been several studies on driver behavior/state detection using machine learning (ML). In addition, in ML generally, the data must be provided to the server for training in a centralized setting. Sharing data will therefore expose data information to external interference and corruption, bringing many risks. Federated learning (FL) recently emerged as new research to solve the tricky problems above. Our research is one of the few first studies that applies longitudinal physiological sensor measurements in a naturalistic driving environment using the FL framework to assess driver behavior/state. The novelty of this study includes the following. First, we use techniques such as synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to enrich and balance the Harmony dataset. The purpose is to increase the accuracy and improve the reliability of the assessment. Second, we incorporate essential deep learning (DL) models into the FL framework, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), 1-D convolutional neural network (1-D CNN), CNN-LSTM, and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) models. By evaluating these models, we show that in the FL environment, the use of compact, lightweight models such as MLP provides higher efficiency than other large, complex models and is suitable for consistent research. Finally, our framework has higher results than other basic models such as support vector machines and decision trees while remaining highly competitive to other DL models with respect to network size, execution time, and stability. Primarily, our idea is the trend of the future. It can be practically applied in transportation, taxis, and self-driving car companies; each car is considered a client, and companies can manage their drivers instead of using a third-party service, which will cause data loss and privacy.

TI Federated Learning-Assisted Task Offloading Based on Feature Matching

AB Mobile edge computing provides relatively rich computation resources for Internet-of-Things (IoT) task offloading at the edge of networks. As time goes on, user tasks present diverse requirements in function, type, dependency, urgency, etc., which makes edge servers take on dynamically diversified service features to adapt to the requirements of user tasks. Moreover, cache has been studied a lot in recent years for reducing the execution cost of related or dependent tasks. However, jointly considering which result data required to be cached and where to cache is still an intractable problem in task offloading due to dynamically diversified and sensitive features of task and edge servers for prediction. To provide more comprehensive consideration, we propose a multiple features matching scheme, coupled with federated learning-assisted collaborative caching, to enhance the efficiency of task offloading. Specifically, we first build a common features of historical tasks based FI-tree to help search for an edge server that best matches the requested task features. This helps to obtain optimal task allocation and improve offloading performance. Further, the results of tasks related to or dependent on cached results can be obtained directly through the collaborative edge cache prediction model trained by two-stage federated learning. In this way, the amount of data executed for offloaded tasks is reduced, thereby speeding up the return of final results as well as reducing the delay and energy of task execution. Meanwhile, it avoids massive transmission of task results correlated data and also protects the privacy of these data when training the prediction model. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the benchmark approaches through reducing the time delay and energy consumption by at least 15.6% and 18.2%.

AB Federated learning, as a well-known framework for collaborative training among distributed local sensors and devices, has been widely used in practical learning applications. To reduce communication resource consumption and training delay, acceleration training algorithms, especially momentum-based methods, are further developed for the training process. However, it is observed that under the influence of transmission noise, existing momentum methods exhibit poor training performance due to the noise accumulation along with the momentum term. This motivates us to propose a novel acceleration algorithm to achieve an efficient tradeoff between the training acceleration and noise smoothing. Specifically, to obtain clearer insights into the model update dynamics, we utilize a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model to mimic the discrete-time (DT) training trajectory. Through high-order drift approximation analysis on a general momentum-based SDE model, we propose a dynamic momentum weight and gradient stepsize design for the update rule, which is adaptive to both the training state and gradient quality. Such adaptation ensures that the training algorithm can seize good update opportunities and avoid noise explosion. The corresponding DT training algorithm is then derived via discretization of the proposed SDE model, which shows a superior training performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

ID CONSENSUS
AB Federated learning (FL) enables multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared machine learning (ML) model while keeping all the local data private, which is a crucial enabler to implement artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenario. Distributed FL (DFL) based on Device-to-Device (D2D) communications can solve the single point of failure and scaling issue of centralized FL, but subject to the communication resource limitation of D2D links. Thus, it is crucial to reduce the data transmission volume of FL models between devices. In this article, we propose a quantization-based DFL (Q-DFL) mechanism in a D2D network and prove its convergence. Q-DFL contains two phases: 1) in phase I, a local model is trained with the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm on each IIoT device and then exchanges the quantified model parameters between neighboring nodes and 2) in phase II, a quantitative consensus mechanism is designed to ensure the local models converge to the same global model. We also propose an adaptive stopping mechanism and a synchronization protocol to fulfill the phase transition from phase I to phase II. Simulation results reveal that with Q-DFL, a 1-bit quantizer can be employed without affecting the model convergence at the price of slight accuracy reduction, which achieves significant transmission bandwidth saving. Further simulation of Q-DFL for the MobileNet model is fulfilled with different quantization bit levels, which reveals their performance tradeoff among the system information flow consumption, the system time delay, and the system energy cost.

AB With the rapid development of the 5G and 6G technology, it has become an inevitable trend to share the cross-domain scattered data and enhance data value transmission. As a new data-sharing technology with intelligence and privacy computing, federated learning (FL) receives wide attention. It can realize data value delivery and data privacy protection at the same time, however, it lacks supervision in the application process, and the reliability of the calculation process and result transmission cannot be guaranteed. As a distributed ledger technology, blockchain has the trust property but lacks computing power. Therefore, we propose to extend the computing and supervision capabilities of blockchain with state channel, using state channel to create sandboxes and instantiate FL tasks in order to realize the trust supervision mechanism based on sandboxes. In this article, we establish an FL-based distributed data-sharing architecture and on the basis of the architecture we design a state channel-based distributed data-sharing trust supervision mechanism. Through theoretical analysis and experimental verification, the supervision mechanism we designed has an excellent performance in improving system security, resisting malicious attacks, and improving data model quality.

AB Federated learning (FL) protects data privacy by sharing gradients across clients rather than local training data. However, malicious clients (e.g., attackers and stragglers) hiding in large-scale FL will severely reduce the learning performance. Thus, how to efficiently detect and defend Byzantine attacks in large-scale FL remains an urgent issue. This article proposes a reputation-aware mean-field-game-based FL (FedMFG) framework, which aims to defend against Byzantine attacks and improve learning performance. Precisely, we first model the process of large-scale FL as a mean-field game problem across clients and prove the existence and uniqueness of mean-field FL gradients (i.e., Nash equilibrium). We then design a mean-field FL gradient calculation algorithm based on stochastic differential equations, i.e., Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations. Based on comparing the cosine similarity of obtained mean-field and individual FL gradients, we build reputation-aware malicious client detection and defense mechanism, which improves the Byzantine robustness of FL with the global learning performance guarantee. Finally, experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms the baseline algorithms in realizing Byzantine robustness and improving learning performance. Specifically, our algorithm improves the model accuracy by 10% and 72.7% for the no-attacker and attacker scenarios, respectively.

AB Federated learning (FL) is an emerging technique used to prevent the two contradictory problems of data silos and data privacy. Different from centralized learning, FL makes it possible to learn a global model while private data are stored locally. Nevertheless, statistical heterogeneity is a major challenge that has not been well addressed in literature and the interpretability of the model is always ignored. In this paper, an interpretable FL framework is constructed for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Since fault characteristic frequencies (FCFs) and their harmonics are closely connected with specific machine fault types, an interpretable local client model is designed to identify the FCFs and their harmonics of different clients. Theoretical investigation on the additivity of local model parameters in this paper prove that learned local parameters from the frequency domain are actually FCFs and their harmonics and their additivity is capable of constructing a fault feature library, which is beneficial to providing different fault information and quickly diagnosing fault types. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by experiments with two independent bearing run-to-failure datasets.

AB In real industrial applications, intelligent methods are recently emerging for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. However, their development is hindered by two obstacles. First, it is hard for an ordinary edge client to achieve RUL prediction owing to its weak computing capacity and limited data volume. Second, as for all edge clients, it is unrealistic to share data with each other due to the potential conflict of interests. Therefore, a federated learning-based RUL prediction method namely FedRUL is proposed to solve these problems. In this method, multiple edge clients and a cloud server are applied to train a global encoder and an RUL predictor without data sharing. Each client includes a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) comprised of an encoder and a decoder while the server includes a same encoder and an RUL predictor. During each epoch, CAEs are trained in all clients through their corresponding local training datasets first. Then, all local encoders are uploaded to the server and aggregated to a global encoder through assigning weights for all clients according to their performance on a validation dataset in the server. At last, this global encoder is sent back to all clients for extracting low-level features from their datasets and uploading these features to train the RUL predictor for each client one by one. Two experiments suggest FedRUL offers a promising solution on confidential decentralized learning for RUL prediction.

However, the sensitive information that leaves the data owner is at risk of being disclosed because the service provider is generally honest-but-curious. Federated learning (FL) is a popular method for preserving privacy by transferring the model from the edge node to local devices and training on the local data set. Nonetheless, the training parameter that communicates between local mobile devices and the edge node may contain the original data and be guessed by adversaries. In order to address the privacy threats, we propose the PL-FedIPEC scheme in this article, which is a privacy-preserving and low-latency FL method that transmits parameters encrypted with the improved Paillier, a homomorphic encryption algorithm, to protect the privacy of end devices without transmitting data to the edge node. Our method introduces the improved Paillier encryption, which brings a new hyperparameter and previously computes multiple random intermediate values in the key generation phase so that the time for the encryption phase has a significant reduction. With this new algorithm, the time for model training is decreased, and the sensitive information is in ciphertext format and cannot be analyzed. To evaluate the efficiency of our proposed scheme, we conduct extensive experiments and the results validate and demonstrate that our scheme with the improved Paillier algorithm can achieve the same accuracy as the original Paillier algorithm and the baseline FedAVG algorithm. At the same time, our method can save a massive amount of time when training the learning model with various settings.

ID DESIGN
AB Federated learning (FL) is a newly emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, whereby a server can coordinate multiple clients to jointly train a learning model by using their private datasets. Many researches focus on designing incentive mechanisms in FL, but most of them cannot allow that clients flexibly determine privacy budgets by themselves. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving incentive mechanism (NICE) based on differential privacy (DP) and Stackelberg game for FL systems in industrial Internet of Things. First, we design a flexible privacy-preserving mechanism for NICE, in which clients can add a Laplace noise into the loss function according to a customized privacy budget. Under this mechanism, we design two incentive utility functions for the server and clients. Next, we model the utility optimization problems as a two-stage Stackelberg game by seeing the server as a leader and the clients as followers. Finally, we derive an optimal Stackelberg equilibrium solution for both the stages of the whole game. Based on this solution, NICE can make the server and all clients achieve their maximum utilities simultaneously. In addition, we conduct extensive simulations on real-world datasets to demonstrate the significant performance of the proposed mechanism.

AB High-speed trains (HSTs) have undergone significant development, leading to a substantial expansion of operational railways. Meanwhile, the adoption of large-scale sensor networks for monitoring trains and diagnostic models customized for railways amplify the complexity and the costs associated with maintenance. In this article, a novel graph federated learning (FL) framework, named GraphFL, is proposed for fault localization of multirailway HST suspension systems. More clearly, the multisensor network is first mapped into a graph with identical nodes and edge features, which is further optimized through graph spectral filtering (GSF) and node-level attention (NLA) mechanisms. Then, the fault components of the suspension system within a single railway are located via graph-level topology adaptive (GTA) technology and a postclassifier. In addition, hierarchical compression and distribution (HCD) is conducted for the parameters of each single railway model to reduce the communication cost during the multirailway FL process. Finally, the personalized model for each railway is tailored through railway-specific optimization. Focusing on the HST suspension systems across four railways, the experimental results show that the proposed GraphFL achieves superior accuracies in fault component location (94.05%) and health status identification (99.33%).

AB The heterogeneous cluster networks (HCN) have recently benefited from federated learning (FL). On distributed data, FL is used to train privacy-preserving models. In heterogeneous networks (HetNet) and the Internet of Things (IoT), FL implementation is challenged by resource optimization, robustness, and security issues. There is a significant risk of data security being compromised by disregarding the nodes' clustering behavior and quickly varying asynchronous streaming data. Moreover, in HCN-based wireless sensor networks (WSNs), FL enhances asynchronous node performance. Using naturally clustered HCN, distributed nodes train a local and global model collectively. In this paper, we propose a Intra-Clustered FL (ICFL) model. By optimizing computation and communication, ICFL selects heterogeneous FL nodes in each cluster. Despite heterogeneous data, it is highly robust. There are currently no FL frameworks that can handle varying data quality across devices and non-identical distributions. With ICFL, sensitive asynchronous data is not exposed to possible misuse while adapting to changing environments. In addition to being time-efficient, our strategy requires low-power computing nodes. According to our extensive simulation results, ICFL performs better than FedCH in terms of computational performance and provides flexible conditions under which ICFL is more efficient in terms of communication. In extensive testing, ICFL decreased training rounds by 62% and increased accuracy by 6.5%. It can execute evaluations 7.46 times faster than existing models, and its average accuracy has increased by 4.39%. A resource-aware FL system can be successfully implemented in real-time applications according to our research.

AB As the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environment continues to evolve, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been utilized to provide several applications such as traffic flow prediction and vehicular object detection. Cyberattacks are on the rise since aggregated datasets from multiple vehicles may contain a significant amount of information related to privacy. Federated learning (FL) has gained more attention as it enables data training on local devices without sharing the actual datasets. However, there are still challenges to security, privacy, and heavy communication overhead when applying FL to the IoV. To cope with these issues, we propose a new privacy -enhanced data aggregation scheme based on FL. We apply not only additive secret sharing (ASS) with homomorphic encryption (HE) but also asymmetric encryption such as RSA to guarantee the privacy and security of aggregation results. In our proposed scheme, a roadside unit (RSU), which serves as a group leader, groups vehicles and then chooses qualifying vehicles to not only ensure efficiency with high accuracy but also to reduce communication overhead and improve the scalability of a large number of vehicles. After the initial training that involves all RSUs and selected vehicles, only a randomly selected group is able to update the global model parameter by reflecting on training their local model. It is also helpful not only to reduce communication overhead while keeping acceptable prediction errors but also to prevent continuous receiving from malicious vehicles. The results of security and performance evaluations demonstrate that our proposed scheme is effective in enhancing privacy and efficient in operation.

AB With the popularity of Internet of Things (IoT), Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an important application for location-based services (LBS). Meanwhile, there is an increasing requirement from IoT devices on the privacy of user sensitive data via wireless communications. In order to provide preferable POI recommendations while protecting user privacy of data communication in a distributed collaborative environment, this paper proposes a federated learning (FL) approach of geographical POI recommendation. The POI recommendation is formulated by an optimization problem of matrix factorization, and singular value decomposition (SVD) technique is applied for matrix decomposition. After proving the nonconvex property of the optimization problem, we further introduce stochastic gradient descent (SGD) into SVD and design an FL framework for solving the POI recommendation problem in a parallel manner. In our FL scheme, only calculated gradient information is uploaded from users to the FL server while all the users manage their rating and geographic preference data on their own devices for privacy protection during communications. Finally, real-world dataset from large-scale LBS enterprise is adopted for conducting extensive experiments, whose experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach.

AB The existing federated structure protects data privacy with only a certain level of confidentiality, and it is difficult to resist the reconstruction of other clients' data by malicious participants inside the federated and the illegal manipulation by external attackers or interceptors on the shared information. Besides, the average fusion algorithm used in the cloud center is difficult to eliminate the negative impact of outliers on model updates, and it cannot handle and fuse the time delay or even packet loss that occurs in the information obtained from each local client promptly. Therefore, to make the federated learning (FL) mechanism with stronger privacy protection ability and security, while effectively avoiding the negative impact of outliers on the aggregation of model parameters. We innovatively establish multi-Level FL based on cloud-edge-client collaboration and outlier-tolerance for fault diagnosis. At first, we build a multi-level FL network framework based on the cloud-edge-client collaborative approach for restricted sharing of network parameters level by level without data communication. Then, the edge-side performs Euclidean metrics on the restricted shared model parameters uploaded to the primary edge by each client, and uses them to identify outliers to evaluate and weight them for outlier-tolerance; Then, an outlier-tolerance mechanism is designed based on a centralized Kalman filtering algorithm that is to adjust the modeling error weights adaptively; Lastly, the cloud center performs asynchronous aggregation on the model parameters uploaded asynchronously by the highest-level edge based on a sequential Kalman filtering algorithm and transmitted the optimal model parameters back along the original path. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on the collected dataset.

AB Short-term load forecasting (STLF) plays a pivotal role in operational efficiency of power plants. Leveraging data from utility companies for STLF in a wholesale market presents challenges. Notably, data sharing reluctance from utility companies, driven by privacy considerations, limits the availability of valuable forecasting information. Concurrently, due to the growing reliance on information and communication technologies, data integrity attacks (DIAs) and communication noise are emerging as a significant concern, which is largely overlooked in existing research. We propose an innovative approach combining deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with federated learning (FL) to construct a robust STLF model that meets privacy constraints and operates efficiently. By employing FL, we facilitate collaboration between the power plant and multiple utility companies to generate a STLF model for the power plant, circumventing the need for direct access to raw data from utility companies, thereby preserving data privacy. To counteract model degradation induced by DIAs and noise in communication channels, we incorporate DRL into our methodology. Simulation outcomes affirm the efficacy of our proposed approach, demonstrating its capacity to deliver accurate and resilient STLF for power plants, even in the presence of DIAs and communication noise.

AB Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has an advanced feature to enhance the decision-making feature and improve the rule-based technique by using more advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based algorithms. In this paper, we chose e-healthcare systems for efficient decision-making and data classification, especially in data security, data handling, diagnostics, laboratories, and decision-making. Federated Machine Learning (FML) is a new and advanced technology that helps to maintain privacy for Personal Health Records (PHR) and handle a large amount of medical data effectively. In this context, XAI, along with FML, increases efficiency and improves the security of e-healthcare systems. The experiments show efficient system performance by implementing a federated averaging algorithm on an open-source Federated Learning (FL) platform. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the accuracy rate by taking epochs size 5, batch size 16, and the number of clients 5, which shows a higher accuracy rate (19, 104). We conclude the paper by discussing the existing gaps and future work in an e-healthcare system.

ID AUCTIONS
AB This paper studies a federated learning (FL) system, where multiple FL services co-exist in a wireless network and share common wireless resources. It fills the void of wireless resource allocation for multiple simultaneous FL services in the existing literature. Our method designs a two-level resource allocation framework comprising intra-service resource allocation and inter-service resource allocation. The intra-service resource allocation problem aims to minimize the length of FL rounds by optimizing the bandwidth allocation among the clients of each FL service. Based on this, an inter-service resource allocation problem is further considered, which distributes bandwidth resources among multiple simultaneous FL services. We consider both cooperative and selfish providers of the FL services. For cooperative FL service providers, we design a distributed bandwidth allocation algorithm to optimize the overall performance of multiple FL services, meanwhile catering it to the fairness among FL services and the privacy of clients. For selfish FL service providers, a new auction scheme is designed with the FL service providers as the bidders and the network operator as the auctioneer. The designed auction scheme strikes a balance between the overall FL performance and fairness. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform other benchmarks under various network conditions.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Federated learning (FL) stands as a robust framework facilitating collaborative learning in distributed Internet of Things (IoT) settings. Nevertheless, the proliferation of nonidentically and independently distributed (non-IID) data sets presents formidable challenges, revealing distinct attributes among local participants within the IoT network. In response, clustering has been incorporated into FL methodologies, bolstering adaptability to heterogeneous data set characteristics and ameliorating the effects of non-IID conditions. Despite its effectiveness, the interpretive aspects and ramifications of clustering within FL have received insufficient scrutiny, constraining its broader utility in artificial intelligence-infused IoT ecosystems. This study exposes a notable drawback in traditional clustering methods within FL, labeled as "Cluster Collapse Disorder," wherein cluster boundaries blur, leaving models susceptible to non-IID data and data drift. Inspired by this finding, we propose clustering-based semantic FL (CLSM-FL). Our framework employs a soft clustering technique based on the inherent attributes of local models, assigning them to semantic clusters for interpretable evaluation of their capabilities. Beyond its interpretive benefits, CLSM-FL ensures resilient performance in non-IID scenarios and against data-perturbed adversarial attacks. We substantiate its efficacy through extensive experiments covering various scenarios and data sets. This contribution not only underscores the crucial role of clustering in FL but also advances comprehension and practical application of FL methodologies in non-IID IoT environments.

AB Distributed machine learning, such as federated learning, protects privacy by collecting gradients instead of training data. Recent studies have shown that gradient leakage attacks are possible in distributed machine learning, that is, the training data can be reconstructed from the shared gradients. In practical applications, distributed machine learning typically uses gradient compression to prevent gradient leakage attacks. This approach not only significantly reduces communication overhead but also maintains model performance. In this paper, we propose a method to reconstruct images from compressed gradients, called Deep Leakage from Compressed Gradients (DLCG). Extensive experiments on LeNet and ResNet20-4 demonstrate that our proposed method is able to reconstruct recognizable images from compressed gradients with sparsity levels as high as 90% and 80%, respectively, outperforming other methods. Furthermore, we analyze the sensitivity of gradient leakage attack to gradients of from different layers and propose a corresponding defense strategy.

ID CHALLENGES
AB Deep learning approaches for malware attacks are effective when trained on the same organizational network. However, it is challenging to develop a trustworthy distributed malware detection model that employs diverse training data from multiple sources. This is primarily due to privacy concerns and the lack of a standardized dataset. Confidentiality trends and cyberattacks require reliable and scalable distributed data privacy technologies. In addition, imbalanced datasets and remote clients make these systems difficult to administer. In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving distributed malware detection system with intermittent clients that uses a deep CNN-based federated learning approach. The raw malware binaries are converted into color images to study visual features. Cybersecurity organizations may have imbalanced feature sets, with clients interacting intermittently with the global server. A data augmentation method is utilized to balance malware data for the local training process. A deep CNN architecture used augmented features to perform local training and generate Local Model Updates (LMU). After that, LMU are sent to the global server for model aggregation. The global server collects all LMU received from various clients and generates Global Model Updates (GMU). The GMU is then sent to the remote clients to refresh LMU locally. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive results in addressing two different issues, including intermittent client and imbalanced data. These results would motivate cybersecurity companies to work together and utilize rich private data to quickly develop an effective distributed malware detection model.

AB Federated learning (FL) is capable of analyzing tremendous data from smart edge devices in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs), empowering numerous industrial applications. However, the increasing privacy concerns and deployment costs of IIoT environment have been posing new challenges for FL. This article proposes PCFed, a novel privacy-enhanced and communication-efficient FL framework to provide higher model accuracy with rigorous privacy guarantees and great communication efficiency. In particular, we develop a sampling-based intermittent communication strategy via a PID (proportional, integral, and derivative) controller on the cloud server to adaptively reduce the communication frequency. In addition, we design a budget allocation mechanism to balance the tradeoff between model accuracy and privacy loss. Then, we develop PCFed+, an enhanced variant for PCFed, with further consideration of infinite data streams on edge servers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both PCFed and PCFed+ can significantly outperform existing schemes, in terms of communication efficiency, privacy protection, and model accuracy.

AB Heart disease is a leading global cause of death, while federated learning (FL) is an effective way to predict it. Due to patient privacy concerns and the centralized nature of current FL approaches, collaborative research in heart disease prediction (HDP) faces significant hurdles in computational health systems. This article introduces a distributed online aggregation method within fully decentralized federated learning (DFL), named DeFedHDP, to address these privacy challenges and improve the model of HDP. Moreover, the differential privacy (DP) mechanism is applied to the aggregation strategy of DeFedHDP to protect the privacy of the patients. The data holder communicates directly with neighbors in a series of time-varying directed graphs without the involvement of a central server. Furthermore, each participant is both a trainer of the local model and a collaborator of the other participants' models. The data does not leave the local device, only the model parameters are exchanged and integrated, and this decentralized approach can further improve the level of privacy protection. In addition, to cope with model gradient disappearance and gradient explosion, the one-point bandit feedback (OPBF) strategy is utilized to estimate the true gradient values. Experiments on a public medical dataset show that the effectiveness of DeFedHDP is close to the centralized FedAVG algorithm for client-server architectures in terms of accuracy and speed.

AB Federated Edge Learning (FEL) allows edge nodes to train a global deep learning model collaboratively for edge computing in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which significantly promotes the development of Industrial 4.0. However, FEL faces two critical challenges: communication overhead and data privacy. FEL suffers from expensive communication overhead when training large-scale multi-node models. Furthermore, due to the vulnerability of FEL to gradient leakage and label-flipping attacks, the training process of the global model is easily compromised by adversaries. To address these challenges, we propose a communication efficient and privacy-enhanced asynchronous FEL framework for edge computing in IIoT. First, we introduce an asynchronous model update scheme to reduce the computation time that edge nodes wait for global model aggregation. Second, we propose an asynchronous local differential privacy mechanism, which improves communication efficiency and mitigates gradient leakage attacks by adding well-designed noise to the gradients of edge nodes. Third, we design a cloud-side malicious node detection mechanism to detect malicious nodes by testing the local model quality. Such a mechanism can avoid malicious nodes participating in training to mitigate label-flipping attacks. Extensive experimental studies on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can not only improve communication efficiency but also mitigate malicious attacks while its accuracy is comparable to traditional FEL frameworks.

DE Vertical federated learning; Federatedk-means clustering; Attack model
AB Vertical federated learning has become a novel approach to address the challenges of sharing training data and preserving data privacy in machine learning. However, there still exist privacy leakage risks in parameter transmission process while directly running vertical federated k -means clustering. To address these issues, this paper proposes a data reconstruction attack based on the distance matrices. The attack model does not affect the convergence speed and results of the model, nor does it disrupt the training process. The attacker only needs to receive, record, and analyze the transmitted distance matrices in the training process, and through steps, as establishment of new coordinate, possible location inference, target location extraction, coordinate alignment, and attribute filtering, can reconstruct the original training data set. Extensive experiments were conducted on three public datasets, the average relative Euclidean distances between the reconstructed dataset samples and the training dataset samples are 0.489%, 0.610%, and 0.887% for small-sample datasets, datasets with diverse data distributions, and high-dimensional datasets, respectively. Showing that the attack model is effective in the VF k -means clustering algorithm.

AB In the upcoming 6G era, vehicles will massively connect to the wireless network through edge access points such as roadside units (RSUs). The increasing number of connected vehicles and vehicular services will take 6G vehicular network to a new challenging security boundary, i.e., the so-called zero trust network. The traditional resource slicing and scheduling solution has to evolve to deal with the zero trust security problems. In this paper, we consider the trustworthy 6G vehicular services and focus on the typical scenario of vehicular task offloading with resource slicing and scheduling. In order to prevent vehicles from malicious attacks by untrusted edge access points, we exploit a subjective logic model to score the reputation of edge nodes. The vehicles will select the edge nodes with high reputation for task offloading. After that, we develop an federated asynchronous reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the offloading problem. The simulation results show that our approach can efficiently schedule the slice resources and effectively protect the information security of vehicles. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Smart health-care is the recent technology, which ensures the early diagnosis and prevention to the patients in the remote area. Particularly, for the serious illness, like cardiac problems, brain abnormalities require immediate attention. Moreover, owing to the commencement of the smart systems, the data from distributed sources is bulky, which imposes the complexity to handle and degrades the diagnosis accuracy. Hence, this research proposes an innovative distributed learning based classification model named federated learning dependent Tawny flamingo-based deep CNN classifier for the disease classification, which handles the clinical data from the distributed sources and ensures the disease classification with good accuracy. In this research, a tawny flamingo-based deep CNN is proposed to detect the Alzheimer's disease, where the parameter of the classifier is tuned by the tawny flamingo algorithm. The tawny flamingo optimization reveals the maximal accuracy of 98.252% for K-fold and 97.995% for training percentage dependent analysis.

ID PURSUIT
AB Traditional machine learning involves collecting data from clients to a central server, where data may not be willingly shared by the clients. In contrast, federated learning (FL) trains a model without data sharing. The parameter server sends a global model to all clients, who train it locally and send local updates back. A major challenge is the high communication overhead from numerous local updates. To address this communication overhead, several algorithms have been proposed for FL tasks, such as sparsification and quantization. In this article, we propose a method called universal vector quantized compressive sensing for communication-efficient FL (FedUVeQCS). We demonstrate that combining universal vector quantized compressive sensing with FL enables dimensionality reduction and quantization of the local model updates without the need to consider the distribution of the reduced data. The quantization distortion caused by universal vector quantization can be considered as a negligible additive noise term. We evaluate FedUVeQCS on image classification tasks using MNIST and fashion-MNIST data sets and compare it with baseline algorithms, including FedAvg, universal vector quantization for FL, Top-k, and FedPAQ. Numerical results show the superiority of FedUVeQCS over baseline algorithms in terms of the number of bits uploaded while maintaining testing accuracy comparable to FedAvg.

AB Private 5G edge networks support secure and private service, spectrum flexibility, and edge intelligence. In this paper, we aim to design a dynamic scheduling policy to explore the spectrum flexibility for heterogeneous federated learning (FL) in private 5G edge networks. Particularly, FL is implemented with multiple communication rounds, in each of which the scheduled device receives the global model from the edge server, updates its local model, and sends the updated local model to the edge server for global aggregation. The heterogeneity in FL comes from unbalanced data sizes across devices and diverse device capabilities. In this regard, we start with the convergence analysis of FL to determine the role of unbalanced data sizes in the learning performance. Then, based on the fact that diverse device capabilities make the completion times of local updates asynchronous, we adopt the sequential transmission for global aggregation. On this basis, we formulate a heterogeneity-aware dynamic scheduling problem to minimize the global loss function, with the consideration of straggler and limited device energy issues. By solving the formulated problem, we propose a dynamic scheduling algorithm (DISCO), to make an intelligent decision on the set and order of scheduled devices in each communication round. Theoretical analysis reveals that under certain conditions, the learning performance and energy constraints can be guaranteed in the DISCO. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of the DISCO through numerical and experimental results, respectively.

TI Does Differential Privacy Really Protect Federated Learning From
   Gradient Leakage Attacks?

AB Federated Learning (FL) is susceptible to the gradient leakage attack (GLA), which can recover local private training data from the shared gradients or model updates. To ensure privacy, differential privacy is applied in FL by clipping and adding noise to local gradients (i.e., Local Differential Privacy (LDP)) or the global model update (i.e., Central Differential Privacy (CDP)). However, the effectiveness of DP in defending GLAs needs to be thoroughly investigated since some works briefly verify that DP can guard FL against GLAs while others question its defense capability. In this paper, we empirically evaluate CDP and LDP on the resistance of GLAs, and pay close attention to the trade-offs between privacy and utility in FL. Our findings reveal that: 1) existing GLAs can be defended by CDP using a per-layer clipping strategy and LDP with a reasonable privacy guarantee and 2) both CDP and LDP ensure the trade-off between privacy and utility in training shallow model, but cannot guarantee this trade-off in deeper model training (e.g., ResNets). Triggered by the crucial role of clipping operation for DP, we propose an improved attack that incorporates the clipping operation into existing GLAs without requiring additional information. The experimental results show our attack can destruct the protection of CDP and weaken the effectiveness of LDP. Overall, our work validates the effectiveness as well as reveals the vulnerability of DP under GLAs. We hope this work can provide guidance on utilizing DP for defending against GLA in FL and inspire the design of future privacy-preserving FL.

AB When implementing Federated Learning (FL) on Edge Intelligence Controllers (EIC) in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), it is important to consider the limitations of the EICs' computational capabilities and address potential privacy concerns. For the efficient and secure implementation of FL on EICs, three key issues require attention: (i) efficient deployment on EICs with limited computational capacity, (ii) avoiding privacy issues that arise from offloading strategies when using offloading to accelerate, and (iii) mitigating privacy leaks that may result from disclosed parameters. To address the aforementioned concerns, this paper proposes a task offloading model called FedOffloading. . Employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques, FedOffloading accelerates EIC training by offloading the training tasks of the model to the Edge servers (ES). It utilizes the Laplace distribution to safeguard the privacy of the offloading strategies. Meanwhile, prevent privacy breaches caused by disclosed parameters, FedOffloading allows EICs to inject different levels of artificial noise before transmitting training data. Experimental studies conducted on a test platform reveal that, compared to classical FL, FedOffloading can reduce training time by 54.70%, and even up to 78.06% when training larger models. The Security Module effectively protects the offloading strategies, meeting privacy requirements while also minimizing training time. In addition, to prevent privacy leakage caused by EICs, we introduce noise in the parameters disclosed during training, and show that the intermediate activation data more susceptible to noise.

ID RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; FRAMEWORK
AB Recently, edge computing plays the important role in Internet of Things (IoT). However, for the emergency scenarios, the capacity of edge computing is limited. Thus, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted edge computing is introduced for IoT. Meanwhile, it faces privacy disclosure issues that the data generated on user terminals (UTs) is transmitted to edge/cloud servers for processing. So, the federated learning (FL) is adopted to train the model. But due to the difference between UTs or data quality, and the dynamic wireless network, the FL faces the bottleneck of training efficiency and accuracy in a UAV-assisted edge computing environment. In this article, a three-layer FL architecture is proposed. The FL training process is optimized by jointly optimizing the UT selection, the UAV selection, the data set selection, and the wait delay selection of one-time training. The convergence gap optimization problem is built by analyzing model training convergence, and the node selection algorithm is designed. Finally, the extensive simulation experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for FL.

AB This letter was motivated by the problem of how to make robots fuse and transfer their experience so that they can effectively use prior knowledge and quickly adapt to new environments. To address the problem, we present a learning architecture for navigation in cloud robotic systems: Lifelong Federated Reinforcement Learning (LFRL). In the letter, we propose a knowledge fusion algorithm for upgrading a shared model deployed on the cloud. Then, effective transfer learning methods in LFRL are introduced. LFRL is consistent with human cognitive science and fits well in cloud robotic systems. Experiments show that LFRL greatly improves the efficiency of reinforcement learning for robot navigation. The cloud robotic system deployment also shows that LFRL is capable of fusing prior knowledge. In addition, we release a cloud robotic navigation-learning website to provide the service based on LFRL: www.shared-robotics.com.

AB Federated learning enables training a global model from data located at the client nodes, without data sharing and moving client data to a centralized server. Performance of federated learning in a multi-access edge computing (MEC) network suffers from slow convergence due to heterogeneity and stochastic fluctuations in compute power and communication link qualities across clients. We propose a novel coded computing framework, CodedFedL, that injects structured coding redundancy into federated learning for mitigating stragglers and speeding up the training procedure. CodedFedL enables coded computing for non-linear federated learning by efficiently exploiting distributed kernel embedding via random Fourier features that transforms the training task into computationally favourable distributed linear regression. Furthermore, clients generate local parity datasets by coding over their local datasets, while the server combines them to obtain the global parity dataset. Gradient from the global parity dataset compensates for straggling gradients during training, and thereby speeds up convergence. For minimizing the epoch deadline time at the MEC server, we provide a tractable approach for finding the amount of coding redundancy and the number of local data points that a client processes during training, by exploiting the statistical properties of compute as well as communication delays. We also characterize the leakage in data privacy when clients share their local parity datasets with the server. Additionally, we analyze the convergence rate and iteration complexity of CodedFedL under simplifying assumptions, by treating CodedFedL as a stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Finally, for demonstrating gains that CodedFedL can achieve in practice, we conduct numerical experiments using practical network parameters and benchmark datasets, in which CodedFedL speeds up the overall training time by up to 15x in comparison to the benchmark schemes.

ID REMOTE ATTESTATION; FUTURE
AB Swarm attestation, as an important branch of Remote Attestation (RA), enables a trusted party (verifier) to verify the security states of multiple devices (provers) in a large network (swarm) simultaneously via a challenge-response mechanism. However, swarm attestation suffers from significant redundancy overhead since all devices in the swarm need to be attested in each attestation round. Besides, it faces challenges such as verifier-impersonation Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, highly dynamic networks, transient & self-relocating malware, and Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) attacks. In this paper, considering not only the detection accuracy but also the privacy of swarm owners in real Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, we propose an Automatic Federated Swarm Attestation scheme (FeSA). Under this scheme, we design a federated-learning-based automatic swarm attestation protocol that enables the verifiers to identify the suspicious devices by a neural network model and then attest them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheme to apply a federated learning method to RA, ruling out the redundancy attestation rounds while preserving data privacy. The FeSA redesigns the interaction model of RA by a challenge-query mechanism to reduce the overhead of an individual device to a constant. In order to evaluate our scheme, we first set up a smart office environment with 12 types of smart IoT devices for real-world data collection up to 21 days. Based on the real dataset, we demonstrate that FeSA can indeed identify the compromised IoT devices while reducing redundancy. We further simulate large-scale swarms of up to 1,000,000 devices to validate the efficiency of FeSA in large-scale swarms. Last, the security analysis proves the ability of FeSA to resist various attacks.

AB The decentralized Federated Learning (FL) paradigm built upon blockchain architectures leverages distributed node clusters to replace the single server for executing FL model aggregation. This paradigm tackles the vulnerability of the centralized malicious server in vanilla FL and inherits the trustfulness and robustness offered by blockchain. However, existing blockchain-enabled schemes face challenges related to inadequate confidentiality on models and limited computational resources of blockchains. In this paper, we present Voltran, an innovative hybrid platform designed to achieve trust, confidentiality, and robustness for FL based on the combination of the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and blockchain technology. We offload the FL aggregation computation into TEE to provide an isolated, trusted and customizable off-chain execution and then guarantee the authenticity and verifiability of aggregation results on the blockchain. Moreover, we provide strong scalability on multiple FL scenarios by introducing a multi-SGX parallel execution strategy to amortize the large-scale FL workload. We implement a prototype of Voltran and conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Voltran incurs minimal additional overhead while guaranteeing trust, confidentiality, and authenticity, and it significantly brings a significant speed-up compared to state-of-the-art ciphertext aggregation schemes.

AB Federated learning (FL) enables the full utilization of decentralized training without raw data. However, various attacks still threaten the training process of FL. To address these concerns, differential privacy (DP) and secure multi -party computation (SMC) are applied, but these methods may result in low accuracy and heavy training load. Moreover, the high communication consumption of FL in resource -constrained devices is also a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel SMC algorithm for the FL (FL-IPFE) to protect the local gradients. It does not require a trusted third party (TTP) and is more suitable for FL. Furthermore, we propose a secure and efficient FL algorithm (SEFL), which applies compressed sensing (CS) and allor -nothing transform (AONT) to minimize the number of transmitted and encrypted model updates. Additionally, our FL-IPFE is used to encrypt the last element of the preprocessed parameters for guaranteeing the security of the entire local model updates. Meanwhile, the issue of participant dropouts is also taken into account. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can aggregate model updates with high security. Finally, experimental evaluation reveals that our SEFL possesses higher efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art works, while providing comparable model accuracy and strong privacy guarantees.

AB Network slicing is a key technology in 6G communication systems to support numerous vertical applications for all scenes while providing resources on demand. Due to more time-varying and dynamic traffic flows, it is difficult for traditional methods to manage complex and highly dynamic 6G networks. Therefore, intelligent method such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is employed into network management since DRL is a model-free and experience-driven approach. However, it is difficult to leverage one DRL model to provide customized intra-slice orchestration for various applications because of their diverse flow characteristics and service requirements. Moreover, training a DRL model is notoriously time-consuming so that it is not realistic for network operator to individually orchestrate customized network slice for each application with the DRL algorithm. Additionally, the data privacy of each application should be considered into the training process. In this paper, we propose a Federated Meta Reinforcement Learning (FedMRL) approach to tackle the cold-start problem in network slice orchestration, while reserving the data privacy. The Meta Reinforcement Learning (MRL) is leveraged to train a meta policy for rapidly learn a local policy for a specific slice orchestration task by finding a common initialization that allows for a quick adaptation towards each optimal solution. With the help of federated learning setting, the training process of meta policy is not required to collect raw data of applications to the centralized server. Experimental results show that FedMRL outperforms three baselines in terms of overall costs, end-to-end latency and convergence speed.

TI SASE: Self-Adaptive noise distribution network for Speech Enhancement

SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Speech enhancement; Federated learning; Noise distribution; Attention
   mechanism
AB Correlation of speech data is ubiquitous in real-world environments. Heterogeneous data involving different distributions hinder federated learning (FL) significantly, which can lead to drifted global models exhibiting intractable convergence. Based on the differences between speech and noise distributions, this paper proposes self-adaptive noise distribution network for speech enhancement (SASE)-a complex-domain denoising model with FL-to tackle the problem of data heterogeneity. We propose a complex-valued time-frequency gate attention mechanism (TF-GA), which is optimized in both time and frequency domains to enable the extraction of rich speech and noise distribution information. Further, we construct the self-adaptive Gaussian unitary ensemble attention (SA-GUEA) block in the SASE network to make it adaptable to the noise distribution. Data heterogeneity is addressed using the SASE model by developing the CommonVoice (CV) dataset with noise-this large heterogeneous dataset contains several speakers, acoustic environments, and noise obtained from different devices. In a realistic FL experimental environment, we also develop the Loss-based and PESQ-based optimization weighting strategies that intelligently update the server model with a large-scale heterogeneous dataset intelligently, leading to better generalization performance corresponding to non-independent and identical distribution (non-IID) data distributions. Empirical studies based on this theoretical framework demonstrate that the proposed SASE model not only exhibits high applicability to unknown noise on an independent and identical distribution (IID) VoiceBank + DEMAND dataset, but also achieves successful denoising for real environment noise on the non-IID CV Chinese + Noise92 and CV English + TUT datasets.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Decentralized federated learning (FL) is capable of enabling efficient and robust collaborative model training with device-to-device (D2D) communications. However, most existing studies on decentralized FL employ half-duplex communication to achieve time-division model aggregation, which is inefficient in scenarios with massive geographically dispersed devices. To address this issue, we in this paper propose decentralized over-the-air FL (DOAFL) with full-duplex (FD) communication, where over-the-air computation (AirComp) and FD communication are fused together to enable parallel model exchange and aggregation, and antenna arrays are leveraged to suppress residual self-interference (SI). Specifically, we first conduct the convergence analysis for DOAFL to characterize the influence of the consensus error introduced by residual SI, channel fading, and receiver noise on the learning performance. Subsequently, we formulate a joint communication and computation (JC(2)) optimization problem with an objective to increase both the accuracy and time efficiency of the model training, followed by developing a JC(2) design algorithm to efficiently optimize transceiver beamforming and computing frequencies. Simulation results verify the superiority of our proposed DOAFL in terms of training latency, residual SI suppression, and learning performance under low energy budgets.

AB The nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique for addressing fifth-generation (5G) new radio services is emerging as a promising technology. In contrast to the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques, NOMA can transmit a signal to various devices from the same resource block by exploiting the power domain and decoding the desired signal using the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique. However, in large-scale 5G macro-cell scenarios, NOMA can need help to efficiently serve far-end devices due to long-distance transmission links, multipath fading, and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) problems. We explore flying small base stations (BSs), which can act as relays to mitigate link quality-related issues. Using the NOMA technique, multiple small-scale flying BSs can fly over the affected devices simultaneously and serve them without utilizing fewer resources compared to the conventional OMA method. We develop a novel intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based navigation solution using federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) whereby cost-efficient multiple UAV-BSs fly over certain areas autonomously and serve ground devices (GDs) using 5G NOMA systems without any interruption. We consider a greedy policy (GP) as a benchmark, where the UAV-BSs fly over high-priority devices to serve them. In addition, we consider the traveling salesman problem (TSP)-based navigation solution as a benchmark. We perform extensive simulation analysis for different system parameters, i.e., coverage time, coverage score (CS), and channel-to-noise ratio (CNR), and conclude that the proposed scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

AB Future zero-touch artificial intelligence (AI)-driven 6G network automation requires building trust in the AI black boxes via explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), where it is expected that AI faithfulness would be a quantifiable service-level agreement (SLA) metric along with telecommunications key performance indicators (KPIs). This entails exploiting the XAI outputs to generate transparent and unbiased deep neural networks (DNNs). Motivated by closed-loop (CL) automation and explanation-guided learning (EGL), we design an explanation-guided federated learning (EGFL) scheme to ensure trustworthy predictions by exploiting the model explanation emanating from XAI strategies during the training run time via Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence. Specifically, we predict per-slice RAN dropped traffic probability to exemplify the proposed concept while respecting fairness goals formulated in terms of the recall metric which is included as a constraint in the optimization task. Finally, the comprehensiveness score is adopted to measure and validate the faithfulness of the explanations quantitatively. Simulation results show that the proposed EGFL-JS scheme has achieved more than 50% increase in terms of comprehensiveness compared to different baselines from the literature, especially the variant EGFL-KL that is based on the Kullback-Leibler Divergence. It has also improved the recall score with more than 25% relatively to unconstrained-EGFL.

AB Data sharing among edge devices belonging to different stakeholders can open new possibilities for emerging Internet -of -Things (IoT) edge intelligence and collaboration. However, traditional data sharing methods enabled through a centralized mechanism were no longer suitable for edge scenarios due to security, privacy and scalability issues. Decentralized device -to -device (D2D) data sharing and fusion is a promising paradigm in edge networks. But cost -inefficient trust management, low efficiency, vulnerable privacy protection and vague assessment of contribution issues are new obstacles. In this paper, we first proposed an IoT data sharing system that supports blockchain and federated learning (FL) to facilitate secure, efficient, and privacyenhanced decentralized data sharing and fusion. To improve the quality of FL -enabled data sharing and promote fairness of contribution evaluation under inferior networking conditions, we proposed a blockchainbased dynamic and fair FL scheme with an adaptive dynamic learning mechanism and a gradient entropy -based evaluation method. In addition, the learning operations automatically performed by the smart contract reach a consensus through the proposed proof -of -ability algorithm, which realized data sharing with high efficiency and autonomy. Simulation results show that the proposed system and mechanism can improve the data sharing efficiency and learning quality, and guarantee fair evaluation and security.

AB Vertical federated learning (VFL) is being used more and more widely in industry. One of its most common application scenarios is a two-party setting: a participant (i.e., the host), who exclusively owns the labels but possesses insufficient number of features, wants to improve its model performance by combining features from another participant (i.e., the client) of a different business group. The best deep ML architecture suits for this scenario is considered to be Split Neural Network (SplitNN), in which each participant runs a self-defined bottom model to learn the hidden representations (i.e., the local embeddings) of its local data and then forwards them to the host, who runs a top model to aggregate both the local embeddings to produce the final predicts. In this paper, we assume the client is malicious and demonstrate that she/he could inject a stealthy backdoor into the top model during the training to misclassify any sample to a pre-selected target class with a high probability by just replacing its local embedding with a special trigger vector regardless of the host-side embedding. This task is non-trivial because existing data poison attacks for backdoor injection in traditional models usually require to modify the labels of a set of trigger-tagged samples of non-target classes, which is impossible here as the client has no rights to access or modify the labels exclusively owned by the host. Targeting this challenge, we propose a SplitNN-dedicated data poison attack which does not require to modify any labels but just replaces the local embeddings of a very small number of target-class samples with a carefully constructed trigger vector during training. The experiments on four datasets show that our attack can achieve an attack rate as high as 94%, while bringing negligible side-effects to the model accuracy. Moreover, it is stealthy enough to resist various anomaly detection methods.

AB The rapid increase in the number of connected vehicles on roads has made vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) an attractive target for malicious actors. As a result, VANETs require secure data transmission to maintain the network's integrity. Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a secure data-sharing method for VANETs, but it is limited in its ability to protect sensitive data. This article proposes integrating Blockchain technology into FL to provide an additional layer of security for VANETs. In particular, we propose a secure and efficient blockchain-based FL (SEBFL) approach to ensure communication efficiency and data privacy in VANETs. To this end, we use the FL model for VANETs, where computation tasks are decomposed from a base station to individual vehicles. This effectively reduces the congestion delay and communication overhead. Integrating blockchain with the FL model provides a reliable and secure data communication system between vehicles, roadside units, and a cloud server. Additionally, we use a homomorphic encryption system (HES) that effectively preserves the confidentiality and credibility of vehicles. Besides, the proposed SEBFL leverages the asynchronous FL model, minimizing the long delay while avoiding possible threats and attacks using HES. The experimental results show that the proposed SEBFL achieves 0.87% accuracy while a model inversion attack and 0.86% accuracy while a membership inference attack.

AB This study develops a federated learning (FL) framework overcoming largely incremental communication costs due to model sizes in typical frameworks without compromising model performance. To this end, based on the idea of leveraging an unlabeled open dataset, we propose a distillation-based semi-supervised FL (DS-FL) algorithm that exchanges the outputs of local models among mobile devices, instead of model parameter exchange employed by the typical frameworks. In DS-FL, the communication cost depends only on the output dimensions of the models and does not scale up according to the model size. The exchanged model outputs are used to label each sample of the open dataset, which creates an additionally labeled dataset. Based on the new dataset, local models are further trained, and model performance is enhanced owing to the data augmentation effect. We further highlight that in DS-FL, the heterogeneity of the devices' dataset leads to ambiguous of each data sample and lowing of the training convergence. To prevent this, we propose entropy reduction averaging, where the aggregated model outputs are intentionally sharpened. Moreover, extensive experiments show that DS-FL reduces communication costs up to 99 percent relative to those of the FL benchmark while achieving similar or higher classification accuracy.

TI FLOW: A Robust Federated Learning Framework to Defend Against Model
   Poisoning Attacks in IoT
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Federated learning (FL); Internet of Things (IoT); model aggregation;
   model poisoning attacks
AB Federated learning (FL) is a promising distributed learning approach to enable intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, FL is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks in which malicious clients abate the accuracy of the global model by committing crafted local model updates to the server. Existing defense methods either rely on a validation data set or simply remove the detected malicious clients from the subsequent training process to handle attacks from a large number of malicious clients. Thus, the performance of existing methods deteriorates drastically in many scenarios where the data distributions of clients are unpredictable. To address these deficiencies, we propose a framework called FL overwatch (FLOW) to efficiently defend against model poisoning attacks taking advantages of the local model updates in current and historical training iterations. On one hand, FLOW detects malicious clients in each iteration by measuring the cosine distances between the local model updates of clients, such that malicious updates are eliminated from the current aggregation. On the other hand, FLOW gracefully punishes the previously identified malicious clients rather than removes them from the whole training process. As a result, FLOWcan embrace a richer reliable set of local model updates than existing methods in aggregation. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmark data sets show that FLOW can achieve higher success defending ratio and higher accuracy of global models over existing Byzantinerobust FL methods under typical untargeted attacks and targeted attacks. Furthermore, FLOW also shows significant effectiveness in defending against adaptive attacks tailored to FLOW.

ID STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT
AB To achieve communication-efficient federated multi-task learning (FMTL), we propose an over-the-air FMTL (OA-FMTL) framework, where multiple learning tasks deployed on edge devices share a non-orthogonal fading channel under the coordination of an edge server (ES). To overcome the inter-task interference inherent in the non-orthogonal transmission among tasks, we design a novel transmission method called model sparsification and random compression (MSRC) as well as a reception method called modified turbo compressed sensing (M-Turbo-CS). More specifically, at each edge device, the local model updates of all tasks are first sparsified and randomly compressed with different random compression matrices for different tasks, before being superimposed and sent over the uplink channel. Then the ES constructes the model aggregations of all the tasks from the channel observation data through a modified version of the turbo compressed sensing (Turbo-CS) algorithm called M-Turbo-CS. We analyze the performance of the proposed OA-FMTL framework with MSRC and M-Turbo-CS. Based on the analysis, we formulate a communication-learning optimization problem to improve the system performance by adjusting the power allocation among the tasks at the edge devices. Numerical simulations show that our proposed OA-FMTL efficiently suppresses the inter-task interference to achieve a learning performance comparable to the inter-task interference free bound at a significantly reduced communication overhead. It is also shown that the proposed inter-task power allocation optimization algorithm further reduces the overall communication overhead by appropriately adjusting the power allocation among the tasks.

AB Federated learning (FL) exhibits promising potential in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) as it allows multiple institutions to collaboratively train a global model without sharing local data. However, there are still many privacy and security concerns in FL systems. The cloud server responsible for aggregating model parameters may be malicious, and it may distribute manipulated aggregation results that could launch nefarious attacks. Additionally, industrial agents may provide incomplete parameters, negatively impacting the global model's performance. To address these issues, we introduce Re_useVFL, an efficient privacy-preserving full-process FL verification scheme. It integrates BLS-based signature verification, adaptive gradient sparsification (AdaGS), and Multi-Key CKKS encryption (MK-CKKS). Our scheme ensures the integrity of agents-uploaded parameters, the correctness of the cloud server's aggregation results, and the consistency verification of distributed results, thereby providing comprehensive verification across the entire FL process. It also maintains validation accuracy even with some agents dropout during computation. The AdaGS algorithm notably reduces validation overhead by optimizing parameter sparsification and reuse. Additionally, employing MK-CKKS to protect agents privacy and prevent agent and server collusion. Our experiments on three datasets confirm that Re_useVFL achieves lower validation resource overhead compared to existing methods, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a network system that enables wireless communication and information exchange between vehicles and other traffic participants. Intrusion detection plays a very important role in the IoV. However, with the development of the IoV, unknown attack behaviors may appear. The lack of analysis and collection of these attack behavior has led to an imbalance in the sample data categories of the IoV intrusion detection, which causes the problem of low detection accuracy. At the same time, the intrusion detection model usually needs to upload data to the cloud for training, which will introduce the privacy risk due to of the leakage of vehicle users' information. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection method for the IoV based on federated learning and memory-augmented autoencoder (FL-MAAE). We add a memory module to the autoencoder model to enhance its ability to store the behavior feature patterns of the IoV, make it robust to imbalanced samples, and use the reconstruction error as the evaluation index, so as to detect unknown attacks in the IoV. We propose a federated learning based training method for the IoV intrusion detection model. Local training of intrusion detection models in roadside units can effectively protect the privacy of data resources. We also designed an aggregation method based on the performance contribution of participants to improve the reliability of model aggregation. We conducted experiments on the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that our method has the best intrusion detection performance. In the case of contaminated samples, the accuracy and F1 score of the proposed method are 9.6% and 7.39% higher than those of the comparison methods on average.

AB The increase in the computational power of edge devices has opened up the possibility of processing some of the data at the edge and distributing model learning. This paradigm is often called federated learning (FL), where edge devices exploit their local computational resources to train models collaboratively. Though FL has seen recent success, it is unclear how to characterize uncertainties in FL predictions. In this paper, we propose Fed-ensemble: a simple approach that brings model ensembling to FL. Instead of aggregating local models to update a single global model, Fed-ensemble uses random permutations to update a group of K models and then obtains predictions through model averaging. Fed-ensemble can be readily utilized within established FL methods and does not impose a computational overhead compared with single-model methods. Empirical results show that our model has superior performance over several FL algorithms on a wide range of data sets and excels in heterogeneous settings often encountered in FL applications. Also, by carefully choosing client-dependent weights in the inference stage, Fed-ensemble becomes personalized and yields even better performance. Theoretically, we show that predictions on new data from all K models belong to the same predictive posterior distribution under a neural tangent kernel regime. This result, in turn, sheds light on the generalization advantages of model averaging and justifies the uncertainty quantification capability. We also illustrate that Fed-ensemble has an elegant Bayesian interpretation.

AB Data-driven fault diagnosis techniques utilizing deep learning have achieved widespread success. However, their diagnostic capability and application possibility are significantly reduced in real-world scenarios where fault modes are not fully covered and labels are lacking. Owing to potential conflicts of interest and legal risks, industrial equipment fault data usually exist in the form of isolated islands, making it difficult to carry out large-scale centralized model training. This paper proposes open-set federated adversarial domain adaptation (OS-FADA) to achieve collaborative evolution of fault diagnosis capabilities among cross-domain data owners while protecting privacy. The OS-FADA is a general fault diagnosis framework that employs two-phase adversarial learning. First, faced with the data distribution shift caused by variable working conditions, a generative adversarial feature extractor training strategy is designed to achieve domain-invariant fault feature extraction by approximating the feature distributions of clients to a unified generated distribution. Second, considering the label distribution shift of unknown faults occurring in the target client, an adversarial learning method is proposed to establish decision boundaries between known and unknown faults. Ultimately, the co-evolution of fault diagnosis models between clients is achieved by combining two-phase adversarial learning and federated aggregation. Results from an industrial gearbox case demonstrate that our proposed method achieves over 20% diagnostic accuracy improvement and has excellent potential for cross-domain fault diagnosis tasks with unknown faults when the data silos problem cannot be ignored.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are getting popular because of their usage in a wide range of applications like delivery systems, self-driving taxis, and ambulances. AVs utilize the power of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to improve their self-driving learning experiences. The sudden surge in the number of AVs raises the need for distributed learning ecosystem to optimize their self-driving experiences at a rapid pace. Toward this goal, federated learning (FL) benefits, which can create a distributed learning environment for AVs. But, the traditional FL transfers the raw input data directly to a server, which leads to privacy concerns among the end-users. The concept of blockchain helps us to protect privacy, but it requires additional computational infrastructure. The extra infrastructure increases the operational cost for the company handling and maintaining the AVs. Motivated by this, in this paper, the authors introduced the concept of gradient encryption in FL, which preserves the users' privacy without the additional computation requirements. The computational power present in the edge devices helps to fine-tune the local model and encrypt the input data to preserve privacy without any drop in performance. For performance evaluation, the authors have built a German traffic sign recognition system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm-based classification system and GeFL. The simulation process is carried out over a wide range of input parameters to analyze the performance at scale. Simulation results of GeFL outperform the conventional FL-based algorithms in terms of accuracy, i.e., 2% higher. Also, the amount of data transferred among the devices in the network is nearly three times less in GeFL compared to the traditional FL.

AB Federated learning (FL) is an attractive paradigm for making use of rich distributed data while protecting data privacy. Nonetheless, non-ideal communication links and limited transmission resources may hinder the implementation of fast and accurate FL. In this paper, we study joint optimization of communications and FL based on analog aggregation transmission in realistic wireless networks. We first derive closed-form expressions for the expected convergence rate of FL over the air, which theoretically quantify the impact of analog aggregation on FL. Based on the analytical results, we develop a joint optimization model for accurate FL implementation, which allows a parameter server to select a subset of workers and determine an appropriate power scaling factor. Since the practical setting of FL over the air encounters unobservable parameters, we reformulate the joint optimization of worker selection and power allocation using controlled approximation. Finally, we efficiently solve the resulting mixed-integer programming problem via a simple yet optimal finite-set search method by reducing the search space. Simulation results show that the proposed solutions developed for realistic wireless analog channels outperform a benchmark method, and achieve comparable performance of the ideal case where FL is implemented over error-free wireless channels.

AB In this paper, we study the problem of privacy-preserving data synthesis (PPDS) for tabular data in a distributed multi-party environment. In a decentralized setting, for PPDS, federated generative models with differential privacy are used by the existing methods. Unfortunately, the existing models apply only to images or text data and not to tabular data. Unlike images, tabular data usually consist of mixed data types (discrete and continuous attributes) and real-world datasets with highly imbalanced data distributions. Existing methods hardly model such scenarios due to the multimodal distributions in the decentralized continuous columns and highly imbalanced categorical attributes of the clients. To solve these problems, we propose a federated generative model for decentralized tabular data synthesis (HT-Fed-GAN). There are three important parts of HT-Fed-GAN: the federated variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (Fed-VB-GMM), which is designed to solve the problem of multimodal distributions; federated conditional one-hot encoding with conditional sampling for global categorical attribute representation and rebalancing; and a privacy consumption-based federated conditional GAN for privacy-preserving decentralized data modeling. The experimental results on five real-world datasets show that HT-Fed-GAN obtains the best trade-off between the data utility and privacy level. For the data utility, the tables generated by HT-Fed-GAN are the most statistically similar to the original tables and the evaluation scores show that HT-Fed-GAN outperforms the state-of-the-art model in terms of machine learning tasks.

AB Federated learning (FL) is gaining wide acceptance across the medical AI domains. FL promises to provide a fairly acceptable clinical-grade accuracy, privacy, and generalisability of machine learning models across multiple institutions. However, the research on FL for medical imaging AI is still in its early stages. This paper presents a review of recent research to outline the difference between state-of-the-art [SOTA] (published literature) and state-of-the-practice [SOTP] (applied research in realistic clinical environments). Furthermore, the review outlines the future research directions considering various factors such as data, learning models, system design, governance, and human-in-loop to translate the SOTA into SOTP and effectively collaborate across multiple institutions.

AB Achieving accurate energy consumption prediction can be challenging, particularly in residential buildings, which experience highly variable consumption behavior due to changes in occupants and the construction of new buildings. This variability, combined with the potential for privacy breaches through conventional data collection methods, underscores the need for novel approaches to energy consumption forecasting. The proposed study suggests a new approach to predict energy consumption, utilizing Federated Learning (FL) to train a global model while ensuring local data privacy and transferring knowledge from information-rich to information-poor buildings. The proposed method learns the transferable knowledge from the source building without any privacy leakage and utilizes it for target buildings. Since the performance of the global model could be negatively affected by some participating nodes with poor performance due to noisy or limited data, we propose a client selection strategy on the server based on the normal distribution for choosing the best possible participants for the global model. Our method enables clients to participate selectively in the aggregation procedure to avoid model divergence due to poor performance. The proposed model is evaluated and conducts in-depth analyses of energy consumption patterns. We validate the performance by comparing its Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and R2 values to those of existing traditional and ensemble models. Our findings indicate that the proposed FL-based model with selective client participation outperforms its counterpart methods regarding predictive accuracy and robustness.

AB With growing demand for privacy-preserving reinforcement learning (RL) applications, federated RL (FRL) hase merged as a potential solution. However, existing FRL methods struggle with multiple sources of heterogeneity, while lacking robust privacy guarantees. In this study, we propose DPA-FedRL,the dynamic privacy-aware FRL framework, to simultaneouslymitigate both issues. First, we innovatively put forward the concept of "multiheterogeneity" and embed the environmental heterogeneity into agents' state representations. Next, to ensure privacy during model aggregation, we incorporate a differentiallyprivate mechanism in form of Gaussian noise and modify its global sensitivity, tailored to suit FRL's unique characteristics.Encouragingly, our approach dynamically allocates privacy bud-get based on heterogeneity levels, which strikes a balance between privacy and utility. From the theoretical perspective, we give rigorous convergence, privacy, and sensitivity guarantees for our proposed method. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets, we demonstrate that DPA-FedRL surpasses state-of-the-art approaches (PPO-DP-SGD, PAvg, and QAvg) in some highly heterogeneous environments. Notably, our novel privacy attack simulations enable quantitative privacy assessment, validating that DPA-FedRL offers over 1.359xstronger protection than baselines

ID ATTACK DETECTION FRAMEWORK; INTERNET
AB The increasing use of Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets in a daily rate has heightened security apprehension, particularly within the healthcare sector. In order to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data, it is imperative for Internet of Things (IoT) systems to promptly and effectively respond to harmful activities. Nevertheless, the act of transferring data to distant cloud servers for the purpose of analysis gives rise to both temporal delays and apprehensions regarding privacy. To ensure the security of medical Internet of Things (MIoT) networks, a power -efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is employed for three primary objectives that it will result in three stages of execution: (i) The objective is to categorize different types of attacks, such as Man -in -the -Middle (MitM) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), by utilizing wellestablished machine learning (ML) techniques. This classification stage will serve to enhance the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and the reporting system. (ii) Anomaly detection (unknown attack identification), or detection of unknown attacks, will be employed to identify previously unknown attacks. This identification stage involves retraining the ML model to enable future recognition and classification of these unknown attacks when the anomaly attack detector identifies that an unknown attack is recognized. Then, a retraining of the first stage classification model is executed due to the anomaly detection. (iii) To ensure that a remote cloud server remains current with the latest classification model changes, Federated Learning (FL) will be utilized. FL allows for collaborative model training while preserving data privacy and security. The experimental findings indicate that the Enhanced Random Forest (also called ensemble random forest) algorithm achieves a remarkable accuracy rate of 99.98% in classifying attacks. Thus, it will be our first stage classifier. Continuing, the OneClass Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm demonstrates a high level of accuracy, reaching 99.7% in detecting anomalies so that it will be our second stage identifier. Finally, the third -stage approach, which has as a target the overall system model updater, will be our introduced Federated Learning approach that works with the Enhanced Random Forests and identifies the ERF differences from the old model in an optimal way. The efficacy of our technique is confirmed through the implementation of experiments involving an Internet of Things (IoT) system and a Raspberry Pi MIoT gateway and with simulations that simulate the FL updating process. These experiments successfully identify known and unknown attacks with a high reliability level while limiting resource utilization and energy consumption. Future studies of this work will focus on enhancing the scalability and efficiency of our Intrusion Detection System in MIoT networks.

AB Misbehavior detection represents a key security approach in vehicular scenarios to identify attacks that cannot be detected by traditional cryptographic mechanisms. In this context, the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques has been widely considered to identify increasingly sophisticated misbehavior attacks. However, most of the proposed approaches are based on centralized settings, which could pose privacy issues, as well as an increased latency leading to severe consequences in the vehicular environment where real-time and scalability requirements are challenging. To address this issue, we propose a collaborative learning approach based on Federated Learning (FL) for vehicles' misbehavior detection. We use the reference misbehavior dataset VeReMi, which is re -balanced by applying the SMOTETomek technique. We carry out a thorough evaluation considering different balancing settings and number of nodes. The evaluation results overcome recent state-of-the-art approaches, with an overall accuracy of 93% using an optimized multilayer perceptron (MLP) for multiclass classification.

AB Over-the-air federated learning (AirFL) allows devices to train a learning model in parallel and synchronize their local models using over-the-air computation. The integrity of AirFL is vulnerable due to the obscurity of the local models aggregated over the air. This paper presents a novel framework to balance the accuracy and integrity of AirFL, where multi-antenna devices and base station (BS) are jointly optimized with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The key contributions include a new and non-trivial problem jointly considering the model accuracy and integrity of AirFL, and a new framework that transforms the problem into tractable subproblems. Under perfect channel state information (CSI), the new framework minimizes the aggregated model's distortion and retains the local models' recoverability by optimizing the transmit beamformers of the devices, the receive beamformers of the BS, and the RIS configuration in an alternating manner. Under imperfect CSI, the new framework delivers a robust design of the beamformers and RIS configuration to combat non-negligible channel estimation errors. As corroborated experimentally, the novel framework can achieve comparable accuracy to the ideal FL while preserving local model recoverability under perfect CSI, and improve the accuracy when the number of receive antennas is small or moderate under imperfect CSI.

   Federated Recommendation; Explicit Feedback
AB Recommendation models have been widely embedded in various online services, while most of which are designed with the assumption that users' original behaviors are available in a central server. This may cause the privacy issue. As a response, we follow a recent work called federated collaborative filtering (FCF) for item recommendation with implicit feedback and propose a novel and generic federated recommendation (FedRec) framework for rating prediction with explicit feedback. Specifically, we federate some basic and advanced factorization-based recommendation models both in batch style and in stochastic style. More importantly, in order to protect the private information of which items each user has rated, as well as not to significantly increase the computational and communication cost, we design two simple but effective strategies, i.e., user averaging and hybrid filling, in which some (instead of all) unrated items are randomly sampled and assigned with some virtual ratings accordingly. Empirical studies on two public datasets show the effectiveness of our FedRec in terms of the closeness of a federated model and an unfederated one, and the usefulness of the two filling strategies.

ID AGGREGATION
AB Simple Summary Automated animal activity recognition has achieved great success due to the recent advances in deep learning, allowing staff to identify variations in the animal behavioural repertoire in real-time. The high performance of deep learning largely relies on the availability of big data, which inevitably brings data privacy issues when collecting a centralised dataset from different farms. Federated learning provides a promising solution to train a shared model by coordinating multiple farms (clients) without sharing their private data, in which a global server periodically aggregates local (client) gradients to update the global model. The study develops a novel federated learning framework called FedAAR to achieve automated animal activity recognition using decentralised sensor data and to address, in particular, two major challenges resulting from data heterogeneity when applying federated learning in this task. The experiments demonstrate the performance advantages of FedAAR compared to the state-of-the-art, proving the promising capability of our framework for enhancing animal activity recognition performance. This research opens new opportunities for developing animal monitoring systems using decentralised data from multiple farms without privacy leakage. Deep learning dominates automated animal activity recognition (AAR) tasks due to high performance on large-scale datasets. However, constructing centralised data across diverse farms raises data privacy issues. Federated learning (FL) provides a distributed learning solution to train a shared model by coordinating multiple farms (clients) without sharing their private data, whereas directly applying FL to AAR tasks often faces two challenges: client-drift during local training and local gradient conflicts during global aggregation. In this study, we develop a novel FL framework called FedAAR to achieve AAR with wearable sensors. Specifically, we devise a prototype-guided local update module to alleviate the client-drift issue, which introduces a global prototype as shared knowledge to force clients to learn consistent features. To reduce gradient conflicts between clients, we design a gradient-refinement-based aggregation module to eliminate conflicting components between local gradients during global aggregation, thereby improving agreement between clients. Experiments are conducted on a public dataset to verify FedAAR's effectiveness, which consists of 87,621 two-second accelerometer and gyroscope data. The results demonstrate that FedAAR outperforms the state-of-the-art, on precision (75.23%), recall (75.17%), F1-score (74.70%), and accuracy (88.88%), respectively. The ablation experiments show FedAAR's robustness against various factors (i.e., data sizes, communication frequency, and client numbers).

AB Federated learning (FL) is a novel distributed learning framework in which clients with models can collaboratively train a high-quality global model while maintaining the privacy of their local data. The heterogeneity of datasets makes the global aggregation and local training requirements of each client in the cross-silo scenario inconsistent. Although many efforts are dedicated to improving the efficiency of cross-silo FL, the task assignment design of cross-silo FL remains an open question. To optimize the efficiency of energy consumption and training time of cross-silo FL, we develop a novel Energy-efficient and Time-sensitive Task Assignment (ETTA) mechanism. Specifically, we model clients' requirements for energy efficiency and training time in cross-silo FL as an optimization problem, and design a utility transfer function to maintain the honesty of clients and the stability of ETTA. In terms of energy efficiency maximization, we analyze the conditions of optimal solutions based on the equilibrium of mar-ginal cost and income, and design an approximate algorithm for cross-silo FL scenarios that require light-weight mechanisms. In terms of training time minimization, we model this objective as a min-max problem and give its analytical solution with Pareto optimality. To ensure that the task assignment achieves incentive compatibility, we further design a utility transfer selection function to incentivize honest collaboration among selfish clients. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the performance of ETTA to demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art and can maintain stability in a dishonest environment.

AB With the development of Internet of Medical Things, massive healthcare sensor data (HSD) are transmitted in the Internet, which faces various security problems. Healthcare data are sensitive and important for patients. Automatic classification of HSD has significant value for protecting the privacy of patients. Recently, the edge computing-based federated learning has brought new opportunities and challenges. It is difficult to develop a lightweight HSD classification system for edge computing. In particular, the classification system should consider the dynamic characteristics of HSD, e.g., the change of data distributions and the appearance of initially unknown classes. To solve these problems, the paper proposes a scalable and transferable classification system, called SCALT. It is a one-classifier-per-class system based on federated learning. It comprises a one-dimensional convolution-based network for feature extraction, and an individual mini-classifier for each class. It is easy to be scaled when new class appears since only a mini-classifier will be trained. The feature extractor is updated only when it is transferred to a new task. SCALT has a parameter protection mechanism, which can avoid catastrophic forgetting in sequential HSD classification tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate SCALT on three different physiological signal datasets: Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram and Photoplethysmograph. The accuracies on the three datasets are 98.65%, 91.10% and 89.93% respectively, which are higher than the compared state-of-the-art works. At last, an application of applying SCALT to protect the privacy of patients is presented.

AB With the rollout of smart meters, a vast amount of energy time-series became available from homes, enabling applications such as non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). The inconspicuous collection of this data, however, poses a risk to the privacy of customers. Federated Learning (FL) eliminates the problem of sharing raw data with a cloud service provider by allowing machine learning models to be trained in a collaborative fashion on decentralized data. Although several NILM techniques that rely on FL to train a deep neural network for identifying the energy consumption of individual appliances have been proposed in recent years, the robustness of these techniques to malicious users and their ability to fully protect the user privacy remain unexplored. In this paper, we present a robust and privacy-preserving FL-based framework to train a bidirectional transformer architecture for NILM. This framework takes advantage of a meta-learning algorithm to handle the data heterogeneity prevalent in real-world settings. The efficacy of the proposed framework is corroborated through comparative experiments using two real-world NILM datasets. The results show that this framework can attain an accuracy that is on par with a centrally-trained energy disaggregation model, while preserving user privacy.

AB This work addresses the problem of optimal resource allocation for federated learning (FL) over wireless edge-networks to maximize the quality of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-based services in terms of delay and revenue. The resource-constrained nature of IIoT devices necessitates the efficient utilization of their computation and communication resources for performing FL. Additionally, the selection of an optimal set of IIoT devices by a service-provider is necessary to perform FL with a required QoS. Furthermore, to ensure the participation of the desired IIoT devices, it is necessary for the service provider to properly incentivize these devices. Although few works aim to address these issues, the possibility of partial contribution of CPU power and dataset by IIoT devices and their corresponding incentivization is overlooked by researchers. Hence, in this work, we propose FedBarg, a game-theoretic scheme, in which we model the aforementioned problem using a Nash bargaining game. We show that the corresponding optimization problem is non-convex. Thereafter, we propose a joint coalition formation game- and utility theory-based scheme to find the optimal solutions. Simulations show that FedBarg improves the incurred delay by 16.7% and revenue of the users and service provider by 14.7% and 11.1%, respectively, compared to existing benchmarks.

AB Federated learning (FL) is emerging as a new paradigm to train machine learning (ML) models in distributed systems. Rather than sharing and disclosing the training data set with the server, the model parameters (e.g., neural networks' weights and biases) are optimized collectively by large populations of interconnected devices, acting as local learners. FL can be applied to power-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices with slow and sporadic connections. In addition, it does not need data to be exported to third parties, preserving privacy. Despite these benefits, a main limit of existing approaches is the centralized optimization which relies on a server for aggregation and fusion of local parameters; this has the drawback of a single point of failure and scaling issues for increasing network size. This article proposes a fully distributed (or serverless) learning approach: the proposed FL algorithms leverage the cooperation of devices that perform data operations inside the network by iterating local computations and mutual interactions via consensus-based methods. The approach lays the groundwork for integration of FL within 5G and beyond networks characterized by decentralized connectivity and computing, with intelligence distributed over the end devices. The proposed methodology is verified by the experimental data sets collected inside an Industrial IoT (IIoT) environment.

AB These days, the usage of machine-learning-enabled dynamic Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems with multiple technologies for digital healthcare applications has been growing progressively in practice. Machine learning plays a vital role in the IoMT system to balance the load between delay and energy. However, the traditional learning models fraud on the data in the distributed IoMT system for healthcare applications are still a critical research problem in practice. The study devises a federated learning-based blockchain-enabled task scheduling (FL-BETS) framework with different dynamic heuristics. The study considers the different healthcare applications that have both hard constraint (e.g., deadline) and resource energy consumption (e.g., soft constraint) during execution on the distributed fog and cloud nodes. The goal of FL-BETS is to identify and ensure the privacy preservation and fraud of data at various levels, such as local fog nodes and remote clouds, with minimum energy consumption and delay, and to satisfy the deadlines of healthcare workloads. The study introduces the mathematical model. In the performance evaluation, FL-BETS outperforms all existing machine learning and blockchain mechanisms in fraud analysis, data validation, energy and delay constraints for healthcare applications.

AB The emerging blockchained federated learning, known for its security properties such as decentralization, immutability and traceability, is evolving into an important direction of next-generation AI. With the booming edge computing technologies, blockchained federated learning can take advantage of computing, communication and storage resources geo-distributed at the edge, so that blockchained federated learning can gather edge intelligence from more widely distributed devices more efficiently. However, untrustworthy devices at the edge also bring serious security threats, namely byzantine attacks. Existing solutions focus on selecting local models that are most likely to be honest, rather than detecting byzantine models and identifying attackers, because verifying each local model separately brings intolerable verification delay. In this paper, we propose a byzantine resistant secure blockchained federated learning framework named BytoChain. BytoChain improves the efficiency of model verification by introducing verifiers to execute heavy verification workflows in parallel, and detects byzantine attacks through a byzantine resistant consensus Proof-of-Accuracy (PoA). We analyze how BytoChain can mitigate five types of attacks, and demonstrate its effectiveness by simulations. Finally, we envision some open issues about security, including attacks on privacy, confidentiality, and backdoors.

AB The widespread implementation of Artificial Itelligence (AI) has led to significant advancements in disease diagnosis. Personalized Federated Learning (FL) trains models tailored to each patient's needs but often overlooks model architecture heterogeneity. We propose a novel Co-training-based personalized FL with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Smart Healthcare Diagnosis (CFG-SHD). This approach allows privacy-preserving participation in FL by enabling patients to keep their model architectures and parameters private. Key contributions include integrating co-training into FL for leveraging multiple data views and using GANs to generate synthetic data, ensuring data privacy. By addressing model architecture heterogeneity our approach offers a robust solution for personalized healthcare diagnostics, aligning with the diverse needs of modern healthcare systems and advancing patient-centric AI applications. CFG-SHD enhances personalized diagnosis accuracy, achieving 97.16%, 98.04%, and 97.88% on the PAD-UFES-20, HAM10000, and PH2 datasets, respectively.

AB In federated learning (FL), if the participating mobile devices have low computing power and poor wireless channel conditions and/or they do not have sufficient data for various classes, a long convergence time is required to achieve the desired model accuracy. To address this problem, we first formulate a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problem that aims to minimize the average time of rounds while maintaining the numbers of trained data and trained data classes above certain numbers. To obtain the optimal scheduling policy, the formulated CMDP problem is converted into an equivalent linear programming (LP). Additionally, to overcome the problem of the curse of dimensionality in CMDP, we develop a joint client selection and bandwidth allocation algorithm (JCSBA) that jointly selects appropriate mobile devices and allocates suitable amount of bandwidth to them at each round by considering their data information, computing power, and channel gain. Evaluation results validate that J-CSBA can reduce the convergence time by up to 49% compared to a conventional random scheme.

AB In recent years, there has been growing enthusiasm for employing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as an innovative technology with significant potential for the next generation of wireless networks. Hence, the Quality of Service (QoS) of clients within the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure can be considerably enhanced by integrating UAVs into wireless systems. However, maximizing QoS and ensuring user information security poses significant challenges in determining the trajectory of UAVs, as they need to account for the mobility and density of users. This article addresses this issue and considers a heterogeneous UAV-assisted network in which UAVs as Base Stations (BSs) have the role of finding the best trajectory based on the movement and density of Ground Users (GUs) in a way that the enhancement of the security of the covered users' information and QoS is guaranteed. To achieve these objectives, we first introduce the Actor-Critic (AC) scheme for the optimal trajectory of UAVs due to the use of a continuous environment with a large number of states and actions. In addition, the accuracy and learning speed of the agent in AC algorithms is higher than in other Reinforcement Learning (RL) schemes. Then, the combination of ordinary Federated Learning (FL) and Distillation Federated Learning (DFL) algorithms with AC is presented to increase the security of users' data, the learning speed of UAVs, and improve the QoS of GUs. In the FL scheme, access to the principal information of users is limited, but it cannot prevent reverse engineering techniques to attain users' data. To intercept such incidents, we use the DFL scheme. Due to the dynamic nature of weight updating in the neural network, this method is associated with a low hacking probability. Simulation results demonstrate that utilizing FL- and DFL-AC algorithms can significantly enhance the learning speed of the proposed schemes, while increasing the downlink rate of users by approximately 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively, compared to the AC method.

AB Recent advancements in AI have significantly propelled machine learning (ML) as a cornerstone of modern technological infrastructure, especially in enhancing machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. This necessitates the development of custom, advanced passive optical network (PON) devices tailored to sophisticated functionalities, heralding a shift towards decentralized data processing that aligns with global data protection and privacy standards. This paper introduces a novel software-defined architecture for TWDM-PON, designed to support Federated Learning (FL) traffic in a peer-to-peer (P2P) manner. Our proposed architecture integrates an advanced P2P-FL-OLT with an enhanced P2P-FL-DBA and P2P-FL-ONU with cache storage and a dedicated P2P transceiver, optimizing network resources and enhancing performance. Extensive simulations demonstrated that this architecture effectively manages increased P2PFL traffic, substantially improving system performance metrics such as throughput, packet delay, jitter, and packet loss ratio. The results affirm that our design not only meets but exceeds Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, making it a viable solution for future fiber optic networks facilitating distributed M2M machine learning applications.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) extend the traditional ground-based Internet of Things (IoT) into the air. UAV mobile edge computing (MEC) architectures have been proposed by integrating UAVs into MEC networks during the current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) era. UAV mobile edge computing (MEC) shares personal data with external parties (such as edge servers) during intelligent medical analytics. However, this technique raises privacy concerns about patients' health data. More recently, the concept of federal learning (FL) has been set up to protect mobile user data privacy. Compared to traditional machine learning, federated learning requires a decentralized distribution system to enhance trust for UAVs. Blockchain technology provides a secure and reliable solution for FL settings between multiple untrusted parties with anonymous, immutable, and distributed features. Therefore, blockchain-enabled FL provides both theories and techniques to improve the performance of intelligent UAV edge computing networks from various perspectives. This survey begins by discussing the current state of research on blockchain and FL. Then, compare the leading technologies and limitations. Second, we will discuss how to integrate blockchain and FL into UAV edge computing networks and the associated challenges and solutions. Finally, we discuss the fundamental research challenges and future directions.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AV s) take advantage of Machine Learning (ML) for yielding improved experiences of selfdriving. However, large-scale collection of AV s' data for training will inevitably result in a privacy leakage problem. Federated Learning (FL) is proposed to solve privacy leakage problems, but it is exposed to security threats such as model inversion, membership inference. Therefore, the vulnerability of the FL should be brought to the forefront when applying to AV s. We propose a novel Byzantine-Fault-Tolerant (BFT) decentralized FL method with privacy-preservation for AV s called BDFL. In this paper, a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) FL with BFT is built by extending the HydRand protocol. In order to protect theirmodel, eachAV uses the Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing(PVSS) scheme, which allows anyone to verify the correctness of encrypted shares. The evaluation results on the MNIST dataset have shown that introducing decentralized FL into AV area is feasible, and the proposed BDFL is superior to other BFT-based FL method. Furthermore, the experimental results on KITTI dataset indicate the practicality of BDFL on improving performances of multi-object recognition in AV areas. Finally, the proposed PVSS-based data privacy preservation scheme is also justified its characteristic of no side-effect on models' parameters by the experiments on the MNIST and KITTI datasets.

AB As a typical privacy-aware machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) provides facilities to individually train edge clients with their private data and aggregate the central global model. In this way, privacy leakage can be prevented. Massive communication overhead caused by exchanging updated weights between clients and the server is one of the main obstacles in this strategy. Prior work advocates compressing the weights by employing quantization, gradient sparsification, and knowledge distillation approaches. However, most of them cannot be readily applied to secure aggregation (SA) in privacy-aware FL. Some research has made great progress in directly utilizing benchmark SA protocols on top of the nonprivacy-aware FL. Graph-based and gradient-based sparsification has been widely adopted in previous studies. However, the results of reducing communication costs are still unsatisfactory. In this article, we present a novel communication-efficient privacy-ware FL algorithm from a distinct perspective. We design a new two-phase sparsification with SA (TPSSA) algorithm. In the subnetwork phase, we identify sparse subnetworks by freezing the initial random weights in sufficiently overparameterized networks. All edge clients collaboratively train to discover their subnetwork inside a dense weighted neural network. Then, the server aggregates to compute the global model. In the gradient phase, for each pair of edge clients, we introduce pairwise multiplicative random masks to identify the sparsification pattern. Then updates from surviving clients can be correctly canceled out during the aggregation process in the server. Theoretical analysis reveals convergence, privacy, and performance guarantees. We show improvements in accuracy, communication, and computation over traditional and sparsified SA benchmarks on two real-world data sets.

AB To provide sustainable energy support while meeting the demands for serving a rapidly increasing number of devices, in this article, we propose a new reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and over-the-air computation (AirComp) federated learning (FL) system which is termed RAPID. Specifically, at each training iteration, an access point (AP) first simultaneously broadcasts global model and transfers wireless energy to the selected devices via the RIS-assisted SWIPT. These devices then use the harvested power to compute and upload their local gradients to the AP for aggregation via the RIS-assisted AirComp. To identify the performance improvement to FL, we first analyze and derive the expected convergence rate for the proposed RAPID system taking into account factors of device selection and wireless communication. We then formulate a joint learning-communication optimization problem in terms of device selection, transmit beamforming, power splitting, receive beamforming, and RIS coefficients design. To solve the formulated nonconvex problem, we propose a new two-stage algorithm by successively solving the downlink SWIPT and the uplink AirComp subproblems based on alternating optimization and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate that our proposed RAIPD system can significantly improve the convergence and accuracy of FL compared with benchmark schemes.

AB Federated learning (FL) enhanced by local differential privacy (LDP) has gained promising privacy-preserving capabilities against privacy attacks on local contributions. In this context, noise-discounting LDP methods have been widely investigated to provide better model performance and stronger privacy guarantees. However, prior art calibrate privacy guarantees by distinct LDP definitions, resulting in nonuniform privacy-preserving capabilities. In this article, aligned with the standard LDP definition, we proposed QP-LDP, a noise-discounting algorithm for FL, which can yield better model performance without any privacy loss. Specifically, QP-LDP precisely disturbs noncommon components of quantized local contributions, which are selected by an extended multiparty private set intersection process. In particular, QP-LDP can comprehensively protect two types of local contributions, i.e., local models and gradients for prevailing FedAvg and FedSGD, respectively. Through theoretical analysis, QP-LDP provides component-level indistinguishability for clients' private local contributions and rigorous convergence guarantees for the global model. Extensive experiments on four widespread databases show that, compared to the standard LDP method, the global model prediction accuracy and convergence rate achieved by QP-LDP can be improved by up to 14.99% and 23.08%, respectively. More importantly, QP-LDP achieves the same level of privacy-preserving capabilities against privacy attacks as the standard LDP method.

AB The healthcare industry is one of the most vulnerable to cybercrime and privacy violations because health data is very sensitive and spread out in many places. Recent confidentiality trends and a rising number of infringements in different sectors make it crucial to implement new methods that protect data privacy while maintaining accuracy and sustainability. Moreover, the intermittent nature of remote clients with imbalanced datasets poses a significant obstacle for decentralized healthcare systems. Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized and privacy-protecting approach to deep learning and machine learning models. In this article, we implement a scalable FL framework for interactive smart healthcare systems with intermittent clients using chest X-ray images. Remote hospitals may have imbalanced datasets with intermittent clients communicating with the FL global server. The data augmentation method is used to balance datasets for local model training. In practice, some clients may leave the training process while others join due to technical or connectivity issues. The proposed method is tested with five to eighteen clients and different testing data sizes to evaluate performance in various situations. The experiments show that the proposed FL approach produces competitive results when dealing with two distinct problems, such as intermittent clients and imbalanced data. These findings would encourage medical institutions to collaborate and use rich private data to quickly develop a powerful patient diagnostic model.

AB Emotional and physical health are strongly connected and should be taken care of simultaneously to ensure completely healthy persons. A person's emotional health can be determined by detecting emotional states from various physiological measurements (EDA, RB, EEG, etc.). Affective Computing has become the field of interest, which uses software and hardware to detect emotional states. In the IoT era, wearable sensor-based real-time multi-modal emotion state classification has become one of the hottest topics. In such setting, a data stream is generated from wearable-sensor devices, data accessibility is restricted to those devices only and usually a high data generation rate should be processed to achieve real-time emotion state responses. Additionally, protecting the users' data privacy makes the processing of such data even more challenging. Traditional classifiers have limitations to achieve high accuracy of emotional state detection under demanding requirements of decentralized data and protecting users' privacy of sensitive information as such classifiers need to see all data. Here comes the federated learning, whose main idea is to create a global classifier without accessing the users' local data. Therefore, we have developed a federated learning framework for real-time emotion state classification using multi-modal physiological data streams from wearable sensors, called Fed-ReMECS. The main findings of our Fed-ReMECS framework are the development of an efficient and scalable real-time emotion classification system from distributed multimodal physiological data streams, where the global classifier is built without accessing (privacy protection) the users' data in an IoT environment. The experimental study is conducted using the popularly used multi-modal benchmark DEAP dataset for emotion classification. The results show the effectiveness of our developed approach in terms of accuracy, efficiency, scalability and users' data privacy protection.

AB In this paper, the problem of joint power and resource allocation (JPRA) for ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) in vehicular networks is studied. Therein, the network-wide power consumption of vehicular users (VUEs) is minimized subject to high reliability in terms of probabilistic queuing delays. Using extreme value theory (EVT), a new reliability measure is defined to characterize extreme events pertaining to vehicles' queue lengths exceeding a predefined threshold. To learn these extreme events, assuming they are independently and identically distributed over VUEs, a novel distributed approach based on federated learning (FL) is proposed to estimate the tail distribution of the queue lengths. Considering the communication delays incurred by FL over wireless links, Lyapunov optimization is used to derive the JPRA policies enabling URLLC for each VUE in a distributed manner. The proposed solution is then validated via extensive simulations using a Manhattan mobility model. Simulation results show that FL enables the proposed method to estimate the tail distribution of queues with an accuracy that is close to a centralized solution with up to 79% reductions in the amount of exchanged data. Furthermore, the proposed method yields up to 60% reductions of VUEs with large queue lengths, while reducing the average power consumption by two folds, compared to an average queue-based baseline.

DE Incremental learning; Decentralized learning; Federated learning
AB Decentralized machine learning has recently been proposed as a potential solution to the security issues of the canonical federated learning approach. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and collaborative machine learning framework specially oriented to resource-constrained devices, usual in IoT deployments. With this aim we propose the following construction blocks. First, an incremental learning algorithm based on prototypes that was specifically implemented to work in low-performance computing elements. Second, two random-based protocols to exchange the local models among the computing elements in the network. Finally, two algorithmics approaches for prediction and prototype creation. This proposal was compared to a typical centralized incremental learning approach in terms of accuracy, training time and robustness with very promising results.

AB In this paper, we develop a blockchain based decision-making system via federated learning along with an evolving convolution neural net, which can be applied to assemble-to-order services and Metaverses. The design and analysis of an optimal policy computing algorithm for smart contracts within the blockchain will be the focus. Inside the system, each order associated with a demand may simultaneously require multiple service items from different suppliers and the corresponding arrival rate may depend on blockchain history data represented by a long-range dependent stochastic process. The optimality of the computed dynamic policy on maximizing the expected infinite-horizon discounted profit is proved concerning both demand and supply rate controls with dynamic pricing and sequential packaging scheduling in an integrated fashion. Our policy is a pathwise oriented one and can be easily implemented online. The effectiveness of our optimal policy is supported by simulation comparisons.

AB Medical image machines serve as a valuable tool to monitor and diagnose a variety of diseases. However, manual and centralized interpretation are both error-prone and time-consuming due to malicious attacks. Numerous diagnostic algorithms have been developed to improve precision and prevent poisoning attacks by integrating symptoms, test methods, and imaging data. But in today's digital technology world, it is necessary to have a global cloud-based diagnostic artificial intelligence model that is efficient in diagnosis and preventing poisoning attacks and might be used for multiple purposes. We propose the Healthcare Federated Ensemble Internet of Learning Cloud Doctor System (FDEIoL) model, which integrates different Internet of Things (IoT) devices to provide precise and accurate interpretation without poisoning attack problems, thereby facilitating IoT-enabled remote patient monitoring for smart healthcare systems. Furthermore, the FDEIoL system model uses a federated ensemble learning strategy to provide an automatic, up-to-date global prediction model based on input local models from the medical specialist. This assures biomedical security by safeguarding patient data and preserving the integrity of diagnostic processes. The FDEIoL system model utilizes local model feature selection to discriminate between malicious and non-malicious local models, and ensemble strategies use positive and negative samples to optimize the performance of the test dataset, enhancing its capability for remote patient monitoring. The FDEIoL system model achieved an exceptional accuracy rate of 99.24% on the Chest X-ray dataset and 99.0% on the MRI dataset of brain tumors compared to centralized models, demonstrating its ability for precision diagnosis in IoT-enabled healthcare systems.

AB Federated learning (FL) that enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping their training data locally has received great attention recently and can protect privacy in comparison with the traditional centralized learning paradigm. However, sensitive information about the training data can still be inferred from model parameters shared in FL. Differential privacy (DP) is the state-of-the-art technique to defend against those attacks. The key challenge to achieving DP in FL lies in the adverse impact of DP noise on model accuracy, particularly for deep learning models with large numbers of parameters. This paper develops a novel differentially-private FL scheme named Fed-SMP that provides a client-level DP guarantee while maintaining high model accuracy. To mitigate the impact of privacy protection on model accuracy, Fed-SMP leverages a new technique called Sparsified Model Perturbation (SMP) where local models are sparsified first before being perturbed by Gaussian noise. We provide a tight end-to-end privacy analysis for Fed-SMP using R & eacute;nyi DP and prove the convergence of Fed-SMP with both unbiased and biased sparsifications. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of Fed-SMP in improving model accuracy with the same DP guarantee and saving communication cost simultaneously.

AB To handle the data explosion in the era of Internet-of-things, it is of interest to investigate the decentralized network, with the aim at relaxing the burden at the central server along with preserving data privacy. In this work, we develop a fully decentralized federated learning (FL) framework with an inexact stochastic parallel random walk alternating direction method of multipliers (ISPW-ADMM). Performing more efficient communication and enhanced privacy preservation compared with the current state-of-the-art, the proposed ISPW-ADMM can be partially immune to the effect of time-varying dynamic network and stochastic data collection, while still in fast convergence. Benefiting from the stochastic gradients and biased first-order moment estimation, the proposed framework can be applied to any decentralized FL tasks over time-varying graphs. Thus, to demonstrate the practicability of such a framework in providing fast convergence, high communication efficiency, noise robustness for a specific on-board mission to some extent, we study the extreme learning machine-based FL model beamforming design in unmanned aerial vehicle communications, as verified by the numerical simulations.

AB Background: Mood disorder has emerged as a serious concern for public health; in particular, bipolar disorder has a less favorable prognosis than depression. Although prompt recognition of depression conversion to bipolar disorder is needed, early prediction is challenging due to overlapping symptoms. Recently, there have been attempts to develop a prediction model by using federated learning. Federated learning in medical fields is a method for training multi-institutional machine learning models without patient-level data sharing.
   Objective: This study aims to develop and validate a federated, differentially private multi-institutional bipolar transition prediction model.
   Methods: This retrospective study enrolled patients diagnosed with the first depressive episode at 5 tertiary hospitals in South Korea. We developed models for predicting bipolar transition by using data from 17,631 patients in 4 institutions. Further, we used data from 4541 patients for external validation from 1 institution. We created standardized pipelines to extract large-scale clinical features from the 4 institutions without any code modification. Moreover, we performed feature selection in a federated environment for computational efficiency and applied differential privacy to gradient updates. Finally, we compared the federated and the 4 local models developed with each hospitales data on internal and external validation data sets.
   Results: In the internal data set, 279 out of 17,631 patients showed bipolar disorder transition. In the external data set, 39 out of 4541 patients showed bipolar disorder transition. The average performance of the federated model in the internal test (area under the curve [AUC] 0.726) and external validation (AUC 0.719) data sets was higher than that of the other locally developed models (AUC 0.642-0.707 and AUC 0.642-0.699, respectively). In the federated model, classifications were driven by several predictors such as the Charlson index (low scores were associated with bipolar transition, which may be due to younger age), severe depression, anxiolytics, young age, and visiting months (the bipolar transition was associated with seasonality, especially during the spring and summer months).
   Conclusions: We developed and validated a differentially private federated model by using distributed multi-institutional psychiatric data with standardized pipelines in a real-world environment. The federated model performed better than models using local data only.

AB In the mobile Internet era, recommender systems have become an irreplaceable tool to help users discover useful items, thus alleviating the information overload problem. Recent research on deep neural network (DNN)-based recommender systems have made significant progress in improving prediction accuracy, largely attributed to the widely accessible large-scale user data. Such data is commonly collected from users' personal devices and then centrally stored in the cloud server to facilitate model training. However, with the rising public concerns on user privacy leakage in online platforms, online users are becoming increasingly anxious over abuses of user privacy. Therefore, it is urgent and beneficial to develop a recommender system that can achieve both high prediction accuracy and strong privacy protection. To this end, we propose a DNN-based recommendation model called PrivRec running on the decentralized federated learning (FL) environment, which ensures that a user's data is fully retained on her/his personal device while contributing to training an accurate model. On the other hand, to better embrace the data heterogeneity (e.g., users' data vary in scale and quality significantly) in FL, we innovatively introduce a first-order meta-learning method that enables fast on-device personalization with only a few data points. Furthermore, to defend against potential malicious participants that pose serious security threat to other users, we further develop a user-level differentially private model, namely DP-PrivRec, so attackers are unable to identify any arbitrary user from the trained model. To compensate for the loss by adding noise during model updates, we introduce a two-stage training approach. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets in a simulated FL environment, and the results validate the superiority of both PrivRec and DP-PrivRec.

AB Federated learning (FL) has recently been adopted to train shared models across industrial Internet of Things (IoT) devices without revealing their private raw data. Conventional FL usually relies on a central server for coordination. However, in reality, the central server is not fully trusted, which means that it may be collecting data, raising concerns about data leakage and misuse. Here, we propose a decentralized FL algorithm based on deep neural networks to address the problem of untrusted central servers. The original problem is decomposed into several subproblems with consensus constraints, which can be solved by local computation and communication. The proposed algorithm combines the decentralized average consensus and alternating direction method of multipliers. Several decentralized algorithms are employed for comparison, and the issue of heterogeneous data is discussed. Experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

AB Federated learning (FL) commonly encourages the clients to perform multiple local updates before the global aggregation, thus avoiding frequent model exchanges and relieving the communication bottleneck between the server and clients. Though empirically effective, the negative impact of multiple local updates on the stability of FL is not thoroughly studied, which may result in a globally unstable and slow convergence. Based on sensitivity analysis, we define in this paper a local-update stability index for the general FL, as measured by the maximum inter-client model discrepancy after the multiple local updates that mainly stems from the data heterogeneity. It enables to determine how much the variation of client's models with multiple local updates may influence the global model, and can also be linked with the convergence and generalization. We theoretically derive the proposed local-update stability for current state-of-the-art FL methods, providing possible insight to understanding their motivation and limitation from a new perspective of stability. For example, naively executing the parallel acceleration locally at clients would harm the local-update stability. Motivated by this, we then propose a novel accelerated yet stabilized FL algorithm (named FedANAG) based on the server- and client-level Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG). In FedANAG, the global and local momenta are elaborately designed and alternatively updated, while the stability of local update is enhanced with help of the global momentum. We prove the convergence of FedANAG for strongly convex, general convex and non-convex settings. We then conduct evaluations on both the synthetic and real-world datasets to first validate our proposed local-update stability. The results further show that across various data heterogeneity and client participation ratios, FedANAG not only accelerates the global convergence by reducing the required number of communication rounds to a target accuracy, but converges to an eventually higher accuracy.

AB This paper sheds the light on road active safety measurements implemented in unmanned aerial vehicles assisted vehicular networks. Despite the great potential of deploying high computing drones, the drone battery life is the major concern, on one hand. On the other hand, road active safety is a critical real -time process that should be tackled in a tight time window in vehicular networks. To meet the mentioned concerns, we adopt federated machine learning on the local vehicles, sending local updates to drone servers. Moreover, a dynamic frequency adaptation framework is proposed to achieve the optimal trade -off between the road active safety performance and drone's energy consumption. The thresholds for the local update frequency are calibrated according to road safety measurements (i.e., collision rate, risky and impolite driving time on the road) and drone energy consumption. Additionally, an accurate mathematical modeling based on M/G/1 multi-class was conducted in order to access the queuing time at the drone.

AB Using pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP with federated training prompts has shown great potential in federated learning (FL) by offering significant benefits in computation, communication, and privacy over existing frameworks. However, existing researches overlook the internal mechanisms underlying federated prompt tuning and comply with the traditional context-unaware tuning mechanism. Our experiments, on the other hand, demonstrate that federated prompting is a data-efficient but data-sensitive paradigm, and therefore, the samples that involved in the prompt tuning process holds significant importance. To address the above issue, we propose Context-aware Federated Prompt Tuning (CaFPT), which facilitates the retrieval process by conditioning on the examples capable of activating the most pertinent knowledge inside the pre-trained models with information theory. Moving in this direction steers the behavior of pre-trained neurons precisely and improves performance on the local task. Informative vectors are built by pruning clients' training data based on their $\mathcal {V}$V-usable information. The study shows that these vectors can be updated and combined through operations like FedAVG, and the resulting model's behavior is steered accordingly on multiple clients' tasks. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that informative vectors offer promising robustness, making it a simple yet effective way to enhance the performance of federated prompting.

AB With the explosive growth of data volume and computing capability, federated learning, which involves constructing global models over multiple data islands, has demonstrated its advantages and vast prospects in the field of machine learning. However, due to commonly vertically partitioned data, coupled with privacy concerns about data leakage, there are still some challenging issues in traditional federated learning. To tackle these challenges, in this article, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving vertical federated learning framework for logistic regression, named VFLR, where multiple participants can collaboratively perform global model training and query over their vertically partitioned data. Specifically, we first design a data aggregation matrix construction algorithm, with which the vertically partitioned data can be aggregated for high-accuracy global model training. Then, by utilizing a novel symmetric homomorphic encryption, our framework can ensure that the whole training and query processes do not leak any private information. Moreover, based on the data aggregation matrix, multi-round interactions are not required in VFLR, improving training efficiency significantly. Detailed security analysis shows that VFLR can well protect data and model information from inference attacks. In addition, extensive experiments demonstrate that VFLR has high training and query accuracy and low computation and communication overhead.

AB Machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) in particular, play a vital role in providing smart services to the industry. These techniques, however, suffer from privacy and security concerns since data are collected from clients and then stored and processed at a central location. Federated learning (FL), an architecture in which model parameters are exchanged instead of client data, has been proposed as a solution to these concerns. Nevertheless, FL trains a global model by communicating with clients over communication rounds, which introduces more traffic on the network and increases the convergence time to the target accuracy. In this work, we solve the problem of optimizing accuracy in stateful FL with a budgeted number of candidate clients by selecting the best candidate clients in terms of test accuracy to participate in the training process. Next, we propose an online stateful FL heuristic to find the best candidate clients. Additionally, we propose an IoT client alarm application that utilizes the proposed heuristic in training a stateful FL global model based on IoT device-type classification to alert clients about unauthorized IoT devices in their environment. To test the efficiency of the proposed online heuristic, we conduct several experiments using a real data set and compare the results against state-of-the-art algorithms. Our results indicate that the proposed heuristic outperforms the online random algorithm with up to 27% gain in accuracy. Additionally, the performance of the proposed online heuristic is comparable to the performance of the best offline algorithm.

AB Currently, health management driven by intelligent means is a general demand of social systems. Although a number of researchers have paid attention to such areas, they have primarily focused on improving the performance of intelligent algorithms. Such intelligent algorithms are mostly based on the central computing mode, where all the user data are aggregated together in a central cloud to implement computing tasks. This poses a great threat to personal privacy due to exposure to the outside world. To address this challenge, this work uses a federated learning mechanism and proposes a privacy-preserving social computing framework for health management. User data are deposited in different user terminals to prevent exposure. A group of parameters are pretrained for each terminal in an iteration and are then transferred to the center cloud for updating. After multiple rounds of interactive training between the center cloud and the terminals, a recognition model finishes training for each terminal without direct access to data from other sources. Finally, this work also conducts experiments on a real-world dataset to assess the overall performance of the proposed approach.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Background Multicenter non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient data is information-rich. However, its direct integration becomes exceptionally challenging due to constraints involving different healthcare organizations and regulations. Traditional centralized machine learning methods require centralizing these sensitive medical data for training, posing risks of patient privacy leakage and data security issues. In this context, federated learning (FL) has attracted much attention as a distributed machine learning framework. It effectively addresses this contradiction by preserving data locally, conducting local model training, and aggregating model parameters. This approach enables the utilization of multicenter data with maximum benefit while ensuring privacy safeguards. Based on pre-radiotherapy planning target volume images of NSCLC patients, a multicenter treatment response prediction model is designed by FL for predicting the probability of remission of NSCLC patients. This approach ensures medical data privacy, high prediction accuracy and computing efficiency, offering valuable insights for clinical decision-making.Methods We retrospectively collected CT images from 245 NSCLC patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CRT) in four Chinese hospitals. In a simulation environment, we compared the performance of the centralized deep learning (DL) model with that of the FL model using data from two sites. Additionally, due to the unavailability of data from one hospital, we established a real-world FL model using data from three sites. Assessments were conducted using measures such as accuracy, receiver operating characteristic curve, and confusion matrices.Results The model's prediction performance obtained using FL methods outperforms that of traditional centralized learning methods. In the comparative experiment, the DL model achieves an AUC of 0.718/0.695, while the FL model demonstrates an AUC of 0.725/0.689, with real-world FL model achieving an AUC of 0.698/0.672.Conclusions We demonstrate that the performance of a FL predictive model, developed by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with data from multiple medical centers, is comparable to that of a traditional DL model obtained through centralized training. It can efficiently predict CRT treatment response in NSCLC patients while preserving privacy.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables large-scale IoT devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving the privacy of local data. To avoid the single-point-of-failure of the conventional parameter server architecture, the study concentrates on the decentralized FL (DFL) paradigm building on the device-to-device communication network. However, existing DFL frameworks encounter challenges related to resource limitations, privacy protection, and data heterogeneity. To overcome these challenges, the study proposes and implements DF2-MPC in industrial IoT, an efficient DFL framework with personalized model pruning and adaptive communication. Specifically, a personalized pruning ratio determination approach is designed by exploiting the model pruning technique. This approach enables all devices to flexibly determine pruning ratios by themselves, thereby achieving both communication savings and privacy protection. Then, this study designs an adaptive neighbor selection scheme, which can enhance model performance and foster model consensus under resource constraints. In addition, the study theoretically proves the convergence performance of DF2-MPC. Finally, extensive simulations on three real-world traces are conducted to corroborate the superiority of DF2-MPC, demonstrating that the method can improve communication efficiency with satisfactory model accuracy and convergence performance.

AB The emergence of mega-constellations of interconnected satellites has a major impact on the integration of cellular wireless and non-terrestrial networks, while simultaneously offering previously inconceivable data gathering capabilities. This paper studies the problem of running a federated learning (FL) algorithm within low Earth orbit satellite constellations connected with intra-orbit inter-satellite links (ISL), aiming to efficiently process collected data in situ. Satellites apply on-board machine learning and transmit local parameters to the parameter server (PS). The main contribution is a novel approach to enhance FL in satellite constellations using intra-orbit ISLs. The key idea is to rely on predictability of satellite visits to create a system design in which ISLs mitigate the impact of intermittent connectivity and transmit aggregated parameters to the PS. We first devise a synchronous FL, which is extended towards an asynchronous FL for the case of sparse satellite visits to the PS. An efficient use of the satellite resources is attained by sparsification-based compression the aggregated parameters within each orbit. Performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy and required data transmission size. We observe a sevenfold increase in convergence speed over the state-of-the-art using ISLs, and 10x reduction in communication load through the proposed in-network aggregation strategy.

AB Federated learning (FL) as a secure distributed learning framework gains interests in Internet of Things (IoT) due to its capability of protecting the privacy of participant data. However, traditional FL systems are vulnerable to free-rider (FR) attacks, which causes unfairness, privacy leakage and inferior performance to FL systems. The prior defense mechanisms against FR attacks assumed that malicious clients (namely, adversaries) declare less than 50% of the total amount of clients. Moreover, they aimed for anonymous FR (AFR) attacks and lost effectiveness in resisting selfish FR (SFR) attacks. In this article, we propose a parameter audit-based secure and fair FL scheme (PASS) against FR attack. PASS has the following key features: 1) prevent from privacy leakage with less accuracy loss; 2) be effective in countering both AFR and SFR attacks; and 3) work well no matter whether AFR and SFR adversaries occupy the majority of clients or not. Extensive experimental results validate that PASS: 1) has the same level as the state-of-the-art method in mean square error against privacy leakage; 2) defends against AFR and SFR attacks in terms of a higher defense success rate, lower false positive rate, and higher F1-score; and 3) is still effective where adversaries exceed 50%, with F1-score 89% against AFR attack and F1-score 87% against SFR attack. Note that PASS produces no negative effect on FL accuracy when there is no FR adversary.

AB In recent years, federated learning (FL) has been adopted in mobile edge computing (MEC) to protect user privacy. However, in some cases, in addition to performing FL to process private data, users also need to process other non-private data. Therefore, how to integrate private data and non-private data in a MEC system for comprehensive processing is an issue worth studying. In this paper, we propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network (WPCN) to process both FL tasks and offloadable MEC tasks of UEs, where the UAV charges UEs via wireless power transfer (WPT) technology, executes offloaded tasks, and aggregates the FL model parameters. To minimize energy consumption of the UAV, we formulate a problem to jointly optimize the hovering position of UAV, the WPT power, the proportion of UAV's computing resources, the percentage of offloaded tasks, and the time scheduling of FL under the energy harvesting constraint. The problem is divided into three subproblems with the aid of block coordinate descent (BCD) method. These subproblems are solved by Lagrange method and heuristic algorithm respectively. Numerical results show our algorithm can reduce the energy consumption of the UAV with low time complexity compared with several benchmarks.

ID SYSTEMS; CHAOS; MODEL
AB Physics-based models have been mainstream in fluid dynamics for developing predictive models. In recent years, machine learning has offered a renaissance to the fluid community due to the rapid developments in data science, processing units, neural network based technologies, and sensor adaptations. So far in many applications in fluid dynamics, machine learning approaches have been mostly focused on a standard process that requires centralizing the training data on a designated machine or in a data center. In this letter, we present a federated machine learning approach that enables localized clients to collaboratively learn an aggregated and shared predictive model while keeping all the training data on each edge device. We demonstrate the feasibility and prospects of such decentralized learning approach with an effort to forge a deep learning surrogate model for reconstructing spatiotemporal fields. Our results indicate that federated machine learning might be a viable tool for designing highly accurate predictive decentralized digital twins relevant to fluid dynamics. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI A Data Augmentation Method for Vertical Federated Learning
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
AB Federated learning (FL) enables various organizations to jointly train one single model without revealing their private data to each other. The FL can be classified as horizontal federated learning (HFL) and vertical federated learning (VFL) according to the distribution of overlap samples and overlap features in the dataset. VFL allows various organizations to share machine learning based on the overlap samples, each one of which has the same identity. However, VFL suffers from insufficient number of overlap samples among all participants. Hence, the shortage of overlap data results in a worse performance of the global model. In this article, we propose a data augmentation method, FedDA, which is based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) to increase the number of training data. We generate more overlap data by learning the features of finite overlap data and many locally existing nonoverlap data, which expand the availability for training the overlap dataset. A series of experiments were executed on both MNIST and CIFAR-10. The results show that FedDA can efficiently utilize nonoverlap samples to enhance the effect of the data augmentation. It can generate high-quality overlap samples and expand the set of overlap samples. Thus, when the VFL is short of overlap samples, FedDA can provide abundant training data to improve the performance of the VFL model.

DE Personalized federated learning; Knowledge distillation; Non-IID data;
   Cloud-edge computing
AB As an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, federated learning has been extensively used in the domain of cloud-edge computing to collaboratively train models without uploading their raw data. However, the existing federated learning methods make an effort to train a single optimal model that encompasses all participating clients. These methods may perform poorly on some clients due to variations in data distribution and limited data availability of clients. Moreover, assigning weights to clients merely based on the quantity of the client data neglects the inter-client correlation. In this paper, we propose a personalized federated learning framework with cross-client knowledge distillation called FedCD. FedCD is composed of a local model training strategy with cross-client co-personalized knowledge fusion and a global model weighted aggregation mechanism via peer correlation. In the local model training strategy, FedCD fuses similar personalized knowledge from all clients to guide the lcoal training of the client. In the global model weighted aggregation mechanism, the server assigns weights to clients based on their influence among clients. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate that FedCD significantly improves the test accuracy by approximately 0.18%-16.65% compared to the baseline methods.

AB Machine learning plays an increasingly important role in supply chain management. Due to privacy and security concerns, enterprises are reluctant to share their raw data, which leads to missing links in supply chains. To address privacy issue and promote data sharing in supply chain, we propose a new federated graph neural network named Isomorphic Federated Graph Neural Network (IFGNN) for supply chain data sharing. IFGNN consists of a server and multiple clients. The server is a lightweight parameter server with an efficient parameter updating algorithm. A client is assigned to each node in the supply chain network. Every supplier client is linked to its first-order neighbors, which means they have supply-demand relationship. The topology of the input network is identical to that of the supplier clients. Experimental results on a newly collected vehicle supply chain dataset show that the performance of IFGNN is close to its centralized counterpart. This work demonstrates that it is feasible to protect supply chain data privacy without a significant loss of prediction accuracy. Federated learning provides anew solution for promoting data sharing and collaborative machine learning in supply chain.

AB Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are commonly employed to mitigate network security threats in various fields, including federated learning applications within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). However, IDSs face challenges owing to the sheer volume of network traffic, high-dimensional datasets and the necessity for real-time detection. Although machine learning integration assists IDSs in overcoming these challenges, modelling difficulties persist due to varied evaluation criteria and levels of conflict and importance. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) solutions have been utilised in IoMT and IDS, yet they fall short in capturing the subjective judgements of experts and rely on normalisation approaches, which can impact results. This study seeks to address these issues through the integration of robust MCDM methodologies, namely fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (FWZIC) and fuzzy decision by opinion score method (FDOSM). Utilising rough Fermatean fuzzy sets (RFFSs), this integration produces precise solutions with reduced uncertainty. Our methodology involves adopting a decision matrix for IDS classifiers based on integrated evaluation criteria, followed by deriving new formulations and developments for RFFSs-based FDOSM and FWZIC for the modelling and weighting of criteria, respectively. Evaluations using datasets involving 125,973 records and 41 features across 17 evaluation criteria revealed that accuracy-security and training time-performance weights yielded the highest scores, whereas false negative rate-security and CPU time-performance criteria received the lowest weights. The random forest emerged as the optimal IDS classifier. Systematic modelling, sensitivity analysis and comparative studies confirmed the robustness of our results.

AB The optimal implementation of federated learning (FL) in practical edge computing systems has been an outstanding problem. In this paper, we propose an optimization-based quantized FL algorithm, which can appropriately fit a general edge computing system with uniform or nonuniform computing and communication resources at the workers. Specifically, we first present a new random quantization scheme and analyze its properties. Then, we propose a general quantized FL algorithm, namely GQFedWAvg. Specifically, GQFedWAvg applies the proposed quantization scheme to quantize wisely chosen model update-related vectors and adopts a generalized mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method with the weighted average local model updates in global model aggregation. Besides, GQFedWAvg has several adjustable algorithm parameters to flexibly adapt to the computing and communication resources at the server and workers. We also analyze the convergence of GQFedWAvg. Next, we optimize the algorithm parameters of GQFedWAvg to minimize the convergence error under the time and energy constraints. We successfully tackle the challenging non-convex problem using general inner approximation (GIA) and multiple delicate tricks. Finally, we interpret GQFedWAvg's function principle and show its considerable gains over existing FL algorithms using numerical results.

AB Training supervised machine learning models like deep learning requires high-quality labelled datasets that contain enough samples from various categories and specific cases. The Data as a Service (DaaS) can provide this high-quality data for training efficient machine learning models. However, the issue of privacy can minimize the participation of the data owners in DaaS provision. In this paper, a blockchain-based decentralized federated learning framework for secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving computational intelligence, called Decentralized Computational Intelligence as a Service (DCIaaS), is proposed. The proposed framework is able to improve data quality, computational intelligence quality, data equality, and computational intelligence equality for complex machine learning tasks. The proposed framework uses the blockchain network for secure decentralized transfer and sharing of data and machine learning models on the cloud. As a case study for multimedia applications, the performance of DCIaaS framework for biomedical image classification and hazardous litter management is analysed. Experimental results show an increase in the accuracy of the models trained using the proposed framework compared to decentralized training. The proposed framework addresses the issue of privacy-preserving in DaaS using the distributed ledger technology and acts as a platform for crowdsourcing the training process of machine learning models.

AB Learning multiple related graphs from many distributed and privacy-required resources is an important and common task in neuroscience applications. Medical researchers can comprehensively investigate the diagnostic evidence and understand the cause of certain brain diseases via analyzing the commonalities and differences of the brain connectomes predicted from the fMRI data across multiple hospitals. Previous sparse Undirected Graphical Model (sUGM) methods either cannot take full usage of the heterogeneous data while preserving privacy or miss the capability of handling the nonparanormal data, which is highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.). This paper proposes a novel and efficient approach, FEDJEM (federated joint estimator of multiple sUGMs), that trains the multi-sUGMs over a massive network encompassing various local devices and the global center. In order to efficiently process the datasets with different nonparanormal distributions, the proposed federated algorithm fully exploits the computing power of the local devices and cloud center while federated updates ensure that personal data remain local, thus defending the privacy. We also implement a general federated learning framework for multi-task learning based on our method. We apply our method on multiple simulation datasets to evaluate its speed and accuracy in comparison with relevant baselines and develop a strategy accordingly to balance its computation and communication abilities. Finally, we predict several informative groups of connectomes based on the real-world dataset.

AB Bridging the gap between the Internet of Things and collaborative robots, the recent advancements in the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) aim at significantly improving production and operation efficiency and quality. As the scope and complexity of IoRT continue to expand, involving also very large numbers of robots, there is a need for employment of innovative solutions such as federated learning. However, this growing demand is accompanied by multiple challenges, including threats to data privacy and model integrity. Besides, the heterogeneity of the robots and their interaction, multiplies these challenges. In this paper, we discuss the key concerns of collaborative training in IoRT, and propose a shuffling-based moving target defense approach for federated learning in heterogeneous cross-silo IoRT environments (FedMTD). Based on a hierarchical training structure with node clustering, FedMTD bounds heterogeneity by domains, thereby minimizing the learning error and privacy loss. It also enhances resistance to poisoning attacks through decentralized credit evaluation. Experimental results show that FedMTD brings significant improvements in learning performance, privacy enhancement, and poisoning resistance.

AB The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) signifies a transformative wave of innovation, establishing a network of devices designed to enrich everyday experiences. Developing intelligent and secure IoT applications without compromising user privacy and the transparency of model decisions causes a significant challenge. Federated Learning (FL) serves as a innovative solution, encouraging collaborative learning across a wide range of devices and ensures the protection of user data and builds trust in the process. However, challenges remain, including data variability, potential security vulnerabilities within FL, and the necessity for transparency in decentralized models. Moreover, the lack of clarity associated with traditional AI models raises issues regarding transparency, trust and fairness in IoT applications. The survey examines the integration of Explainable AI (XAI) and FL within the Next Generation IoT framework. It provides a thorough analysis of how XAI techniques can elucidate the mechanisms of FL models, addressing challenges such as communication overhead, data heterogeneity and privacy-preserving explanation methods. The survey brings attention to the benefits of FL, including secure data sharing, effective modeling of heterogeneous data and improved communication and interoperability. Additionally, it presents mathematical formulations of the challenges in FL and discusses potential solutions aimed at enhancing the resilience and scalability of IoT implementations. Eventually, convergence of XAI and FL enhances interpretability and promotes the development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems, establishing a strong foundation for impactful applications in the ever evolving Next-Generation IoT landscape.

AB Wireless federated learning (WFL) undergoes a communication bottleneck in uplink, limiting the number of users that can upload their local models in each global aggregation round. This paper presents a new multi-carrier non-orthogonal multiple-access (MC-NOMA)-empowered WFL system under an adaptive learning setting of Flexible Aggregation. Since a WFL round accommodates both local model training and uploading for each user, the use of Flexible Aggregation allows the users to train different numbers of iterations per round, adapting to their channel conditions and computing resources. The key idea is to use MC-NOMA to concurrently upload the local models of the users, thereby extending the local model training times of the users and increasing participating users. A new metric, namely, Weighted Global Proportion of Trained Mini-batches (WGPTM), is analytically established to measure the convergence of the new system. Another important aspect is that we maximize the WGPTM to harness the convergence of the new system by jointly optimizing the transmit powers and subchannel bandwidths. This nonconvex problem is converted equivalently to a tractable convex problem and solved efficiently using variable substitution and Cauchy's inequality. As corroborated experimentally using a convolutional neural network and an 18-layer residential network, the proposed MC-NOMA WFL can efficiently reduce communication delay, increase local model training times, and accelerate the convergence by over 40%, compared to its existing alternative.

TI Performance Analysis of Federated Learning Algorithms for Multilingual

AB Data scientists in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field confront the challenge of reconciling the necessity for data-centric analyses with the imperative to safeguard sensitive information, all while managing the substantial costs linked to the collection process of training data. In a Federated Learning (FL) system, these challenges can be alleviated by the training of a global model, eliminating the need to centralize sensitive data of clients. However, distributed NLP data is usually Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID), which leads to poorer generalizability of the global model when trained with Federated Averaging (FedAvg). Recently proposed extensions to FedAvg promise to improve the global model performance on Non-IID data. Yet, such advanced FL algorithms trained on multilingual Non-IID texts have not been studied in industry and academia in detail. This paper compares, for the first time, the FL algorithms: FedAvg, FedAvgM, FedYogi, FedAdam and FedAdagrad for a binary text classification task using 12078 tailored real-world news reports in English, Portuguese, Spanish and Hindi. For this objective, pre-trained DistilBERT and BERT models fine-tuned with these texts are used. The paper results show that FedYogi is the most stable and robust FL algorithm when DistilBERT is used, achieving an average macro F1 score of 0.7789 for IID and 0.7755 for Non-IID protest news. The study also exhibits that BERT models trained with weighted FedAvg and FedAvgM can achieve a similar prediction power as centralized language models, demonstrating the potential of leveraging FL in the NLP domain without the need to collect data centrally.

ID PREDICTION
AB Industry 5.0 facilitates the intelligent upgrade of smart factories in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and also introduces a plethora of data processing challenges. Mobile edge computing offloads data to edge servers for processing, easing the data processing pressure and reducing system cost. However, smart factories contain numerous sensitive information, and offloading them to edge servers directly may pose a risk of data leakage. To address these challenges, we investigate a local-edge collaborative smart factory system. Specifically, we first model the tasks as a directed acyclic graph, and formulate the offloading problem as a Markov decision process, considering the optimization of latency, energy consumption and the number of overtime tasks. Then, we propose a security-aware computation offloading method using federated reinforcement learning in IIoT, named SCOF. SCOF employs federated learning, keeping data for local computation and uploading model parameters to edge servers for aggregation. The data transmission passes through an artificial noise channel to protect against eavesdropping. Meanwhile, SCOF utilizes differential privacy to protect data security and employs deep reinforcement learning for selecting near-optimal offloading decisions. Finally, abundant experiments are conducted under a real dataset. The results show that SCOF has better perfomance than the state-of-the-art baseline algorithms.

AB In this paper, we design, analyze the convergence properties, address the implementation aspects, and numerically test the performance of AFAFed. This is a novel Asynchronous Fair Adaptive Federated learning framework for stream-oriented IoT application environments, which are featured by time-varying operating conditions, heterogeneous resource-limited devices (i.e., coworkers), non-i.i.d. local training data and unre-liable communication links. The key new of AFAFed is the synergic co-design of: (i) two sets of adaptively tuned tolerance thresholds and fairness coefficients at the coworkers and central server, respectively; and, (ii) a distributed adaptive mechanism, which allows each coworker to adaptively tune own communication rate. The convergence properties of AFAFed under (possibly) non-convex loss functions is guaranteed by a set of new analytical bounds, which formally unveil the impact on the resulting AFAFed convergence rate of a number of Federated Learning (FL) parameters, like, first and second moments of the per-coworker number of consecutive model updates, data skewness, communication packet-loss probability, and maximum/minimum values of the (adaptively tuned) mixing coefficient used for model aggregation. Extensive numerical tests show that AFAFed is capable to improve test accuracy by up to 20% and reduce training time by up to 50%, compared to state-of-the-art FL schemes, even under challenging learning scenarios featured by deep Machine Learning (ML) models, data skewness, coworker heterogeneity and unreliable communication.

AB Training an object detection model often requires numerous annotated images on a centralized host, which may violate user privacy and data confidentiality. Federated learning (FL) resolves this issue by allowing multiple clients, e.g., cameras, to collaboratively train a model while protecting user privacy. However, models trained with FL may fail to be generalized for new target domain due to domain shift when the data between source and target domains are statistically different. In this work, we formulate a real-world object detection problem as a source-free multi-domain adaptation problem in FL architecture. Moreover, we propose an adaptive FL algorithm, called FedDAD (Federated Domain Adaptive Detector), which aggregates models with dynamic attention targeting the unsupervised domain on server, and utilize instance-level alignment to alleviate the effects of scene variation on clients.

AB Federated Learning (FL), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are the most trending and exciting technology in the intelligent healthcare field. Traditionally, the healthcare system works based on centralized agents sharing their raw data. Therefore, huge vulnerabilities and challenges are still existing in this system. However, integrating with AI, the system would be multiple agent collaborators who are capable of communicating with their desired host efficiently. Again, FL is another interesting feature, which works decentralized manner; it maintains the communication based on a model in the preferred system without transferring the raw data. The combination of FL, AI, and XAI techniques can be capable of minimizing several limitations and challenges in the healthcare system. This paper presents a complete analysis of FL using AI for smart healthcare applications. Initially, we discuss contemporary concepts of emerging technologies such as FL, AI, XAI, and the healthcare system. We integrate and classify the FL-AI with healthcare technologies in different domains. Further, we address the existing problems, including security, privacy, stability, and reliability in the healthcare field. In addition, we guide the readers to solving strategies of healthcare using FL and AI. Finally, we address extensive research areas as well as future potential prospects regarding FL-based AI research in the healthcare management system.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The chest lesion caused by COVID-19 infection pandemic is threatening the lives and well-being of people all over the world. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based strategies are efficient methods for helping radiologists by assessing the vast number of chest X-ray images, which may play a significant role in simplifying and improving the diagnosis of chest lesion caused by COVID-19 infection. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are such AI strategies that have helped researchers predict chest lesion caused by COVID-19 infection cases. But ML and DL strategies face challenges like transmission delays, a lack of computing power, communication delays, and privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) is a new development in ML that makes it easier to collect, process, and analyze large amounts of multidimensional data. This could help solve the challenges that have been identified in ML and DL. However, FL algorithms send and receive large amounts of weights from client-side trained models, resulting in significant communication overhead. To address this problem, we offer a unified framework combining FL and a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to speed up the government's response time to chest lesion caused by COVID-19 infection outbreaks. The Federated Particle Swarm Optimization approach is tested on a multidimensional chest lesion caused by the COVID-19 infection image dataset and the chest X-ray (pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle's repository. Our research shows that the proposed model works better when there is an uneven amount of data, has lower communication costs, and is therefore more efficient from a network's point of view. The results of the proposed approach were validated; 96.15% prediction accuracy was achieved for chest lesions caused by the COVID-19 infection dataset, and 96.55% prediction accuracy was achieved for the chest X-ray (pneumonia) dataset. These results can be used to develop a progressive approach for the early detection of chest lesion caused by COVID-19 infection.

AB In this paper, a Device-to-Device communication on unlicensed bands (D2D-U) enabled network is studied. To improve the spectrum efficiency (SE) on the unlicensed bands and fit its distributed structure while ensuring the fairness among D2D-U links and the harmonious coexistence with WiFi networks, a distributed joint power and spectrum scheme is proposed. In particular, a parameter, named as price, is defined, which is updated at each D2D-U pair by a online trained Neural network (NN) according to the channel state and traffic load. In addition, the parameters used in the NN are updated by two ways, unsupervised self-iteration and federated learning, to guarantee the fairness and harmonious coexistence. Then, a non-convex optimization problem with respect to the spectrum and power is formulated and solved on each D2D-U link to maximize its own data rate. Numerical simulation results are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an appealing machine learning approach to deal with massive raw data generated at multiple mobile devices, which needs to aggregate the training parameter of every mobile device at one base station (BS) iteratively. For parameter aggregating in FL, over-the-air computation is a spectrum-efficient solution, which allows all mobile devices to transmit their parameter-mapped signals concurrently to a BS. Due to heterogeneous channel fading and noise, there exists difference between the BS's received signal and its desired signal, measured as the mean-squared error (MSE). To minimize the MSE, we propose to jointly optimize the signal amplification factors at the BS and the mobile devices as well as the data size (the number of data samples involved in local training) at every mobile device. The formulated problem is difficult to address due to its nonconvexity. To find the optimal solution, we perform cost function simplification and variable transformation, and solve the transformed problem in a two-level structure. Optimal solution of the lower level problem is found by analyzing every candidate solution from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. Optimal solution of the upper level problem is found by exploring its piecewise convexity. Numerical results show that our proposed method can greatly reduce the MSE and can help to enhance the training performance of FL compared with benchmark methods.

AB Federated Learning (FL) is a paradigm in Machine Learning (ML) that addresses data privacy, security, access rights and access to heterogeneous information issues by training a global model using distributed nodes. Despite its advantages, there is an increased potential for cyberattacks on FL-based ML techniques that can undermine the benefits. Model-poisoning attacks on FL target the availability of the model. The adversarial objective is to disrupt the training. We propose attestedFL, a defense mechanism that monitors the training of individual nodes through state persistence in order to detect a malicious worker in small to medium federation size. A fine-grained assessment of the history of the worker permits the evaluation of its behavior in time and results in innovative detection strategies. We present three lines of defense that aim at assessing if the worker is reliable by observing if the node is truly training, while advancing towards a goal. Our defense exposes an attacker's malicious behavior and removes unreliable nodes from the aggregation process so that the FL process converge faster. attestedFL increased the accuracy of the model in different FL settings, under different attacking patterns, and scenarios e.g., attacks performed at different stages of the convergence, colluding attackers, and continuous attacks.

AB Distributed data stream mining has gained increasing attention in recent years since many organizations collect tremendous amounts of streaming data from different locations. Existing studies mainly focus on learning evolving concepts on distributed data streams, while the privacy issue is little investigated. In this article, for the first time, we develop a federated learning framework for distributed concept-drifting data streams, called FedStream. The proposed method allows capturing the evolving concepts by dynamically maintaining a set of prototypes with error-driven representative learning. Meanwhile, a new metric-learning-based prototype transformation technique is introduced to preserve privacy among participating clients in the distributed data streams setting. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets have demonstrated the superiority of FedStream, and it even achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art distributed learning methods.

AB Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train machine learning models while preserving the model privacy of the clients. However, when generating a global model during the aggregation process, a malicious FL server could derive clients' local model weights. Such a threat cannot be completely eliminated, even if model aggregation is performed in the Trusted Execution Environment of the server, due to memory access pattern attacks. To tackle this challenge, our paper focuses on the top-k model aggregation algorithm in FL and introduces a space efficient and oblivious sparsified model aggregation algorithm named Sort-Then-Insert (STI), which removes the dependency of the memory access pattern on the model input, thus protecting the confidentiality of clients' models. Compared with Path ORAM, STI is over 100 times faster, and compared with the state-of-the-art solution for the same problem, Olive, our theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that STI can achieve comparable performance overhead ( O ( nk log 2 ( nk )) + O ( d log2(d)) for STI vs. O((nk+d) log2(nk+d)) for Olive) and reduced space overhead ( max( O ( nk ) , O ( d )) for STI vs. O(nk+d) for Olive).

ID CLIENT SELECTION
AB In federated learning (FL), to minimize the convergence time while reaching a desired accuracy, it is important to select appropriate mobile devices (MDs) as participants with the considerations of their characteristics (e.g., data distribution, channel condition, and computing power). In this article, we first formulate a Markov decision process-based MD selection problem in which the increased accuracy per unit-time is maximized. To solve the formulated problem without any prior knowledge of the environment, a deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm can be exploited. However, storing previous experiences into the replay memory for DQN consumes an increased time since the FL server needs to conduct a number of actual FL procedures and observe the resulted rewards. To address this problem, we proposed a virtual experience-based MD selection algorithm (VE-MSA). In VE-MSA, the FL server generates virtual experiences (especially reward) without any actual FL procedures by using two neural networks approximating the round time and the increased accuracy in a round according to the selected MDs, respectively. Evaluation results demonstrate that the derived optimal policy can achieve a target accuracy within the shortest time among comparison schemes.

AB Although deep learning models have shown promising results in solving problems related to image recognition or natural language processing, they do not match how the biological brain works. Some of the differences include the amount of energy consumed, the way neurons communicate, or the way they learn. To close the gap between artificial neural networks and biological ones, researchers proposed the spiking neural network. Layered Spiking Neural P systems (LSN P systems) are networks of spiking neurons used to solve various classification problems. In this paper, we study the LSN P systems in the context of a federated learning client-server architecture over horizontally partitioned data. We analyze the privacy implications of pre-trained LSN P systems through membership inference attacks. We also perform experiments to assess the performance of an LSN P system trained in the federated learning setup. Our findings suggest that LSN P systems demonstrate higher accuracy and faster convergence compared to federated algorithms based on either perceptron or spiking neural networks.

TI FedLEO: An Offloading-Assisted Decentralized Federated Learning
   Framework for Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING

ID CHALLENGES; COMMUNICATION; ARCHITECTURE
AB Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites enable complex Earth observation tasks (e.g., remote sensing and cooperative monitoring) by leveraging large-scale satellite-generated Earth imageries and state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques. However, due to restricted downlink bandwidth and spotty connectivity, it is infeasible for the satellites to transmit all the imageries to ground stations for ML model training. To address this issue, we use federated learning (FL) to mitigate the significant overhead of raw data transmission only by enabling model parameter exchange. Traditional FL requires a central server for model parameter aggregation, which is impractical for distributed LEO satellite constellation due to the difficulty of identifying a suitable central satellite. To tackle such challenge, we take the unique topological characteristics of the LEO satellite constellation to design a decentralized FL framework that enables efficient model aggregation in LEO satellite networks without a central server. The framework can avoid the reliability and communication bandwidth problems of the central server in centralized FL. To mitigate the straggler effect and address the statistical heterogeneity, we then propose a novel offloading framework for decentralized FL in LEO satellite networks to aid the collaboration among multiple satellites for resource sharing. Based on it, we derive a satellite-centric threshold-based offloading strategy and a system-wide greedy-based iterative offloading decision making algorithm, in order to achieve delay and accuracy optimization under the computation and communication power constraints. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed framework contributes to the high training performance of the global model. Extensive experiments based on realistic datasets show that the proposed framework can reduce the system delay by up to 41% on average and improve the global model accuracy by up to 9.39% compared with benchmark policies.

TI FedDCT: Federated Learning of Large Convolutional Neural Networks on
   Resource-Constrained Devices Using Divide and Collaborative Training
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT

   edge devices; edge learning; collaborative training
AB In Federated Learning (FL), the size of local models matters. On the one hand, it is logical to use large-capacity neural networks in pursuit of high performance. On the other hand, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are exceedingly parameter-hungry, which makes memory a significant bottleneck when training large-scale CNNs on hardware-constrained devices such as smartphones or wearables sensors. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) FL approaches either only test their convergence properties on tiny CNNs with inferior accuracy or assume clients have the adequate processing power to train large models, which remains a formidable obstacle in actual practice. To overcome these issues, we introduce FedDCT, a novel distributed learning paradigm that enables the usage of large, high-performance CNNs on resource-limited edge devices. As opposed to traditional FL approaches, which require each client to train the full-size neural network independently during each training round, the proposed FedDCT allows a cluster of several clients to collaboratively train a large deep learning model by dividing it into an ensemble of several small sub-models and train them on multiple devices in parallel while maintaining privacy. In this collaborative training process, clients from the same cluster can also learn from each other, further improving their ensemble performance. In the aggregation stage, the server takes a weighted average of all the ensemble models trained by all the clusters. FedDCT reduces the memory requirements and allows low-end devices to participate in FL. We empirically conduct extensive experiments on standardized datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and two real-world medical datasets HAM10000 and VAIPE. Experimental results show that FedDCT outperforms a set of current SOTA FL methods with interesting convergence behaviors. Furthermore, compared to other existing approaches, FedDCT achieves higher accuracy and substantially reduces the number of communication rounds (with 4-8 times fewer memory requirements) to achieve the desired accuracy on the testing dataset without incurring any extra training cost on the server side.

AB A central question in edge intelligence is "how can an edge device learn its local model with limited data and constrained computing capacity?" In this study, we explore the approach where a global model initialization is first obtained by running federated learning (FL) across multiple edge devices, based on which a semi-supervised algorithm is devised for a single edge device to carry out quick adaptation with its local data. Specifically, to account for device heterogeneity and resource constraints, a global model is first trained via FL, where each device conducts multiple local updates only for its customized subnet. A subset of devices can be selected to upload updates for aggregation during each training round. Further, device scheduling is optimized to minimize the training loss of FL, subject to resource constraints, based on the carefully crafted reward function defined as the one-round progress of FL each device can provide. We examine the convergence behavior of FL for the general non-convex case. For semi-supervised model personalization, we use the FL-based model initialization as a teacher network to impute soft labels on unlabeled data, thereby addressing the insufficiency of labeled data. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

AB Federated learning (FL) enables wireless terminals to collaboratively learn a shared parameter model while keeping all the training data on devices per se. Parameter sharing consists of synchronous and asynchronous ways: the former transmits parameters as blocks or frames and waits until all transmissions finish, whereas the latter provides messages about the status of pending and failed parameter transmission requests. Whatever synchronous or asynchronous parameter sharing is applied, the learning model shall adapt to distinct network architectures as an improper learning model will deteriorate learning performance and, even worse, lead to model divergence for the asynchronous transmission in resource-limited large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This article proposes a decentralized learning model and develops an asynchronous parameter-sharing algorithm for resource-limited distributed IoT networks. This decentralized learning model approaches a convex function as the number of nodes increases, and its learning process converges to a global stationary point with a higher probability than the centralized FL model. Moreover, by jointly accounting for the convergence bound of FL and the transmission delay of wireless communications, we develop a node scheduling and bandwidth allocation algorithm to minimize the transmission delay. Extensive simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the distributed algorithm in terms of fast learning model convergence and low-transmission delay.

TI A participant selection based vehicle platoon asynchronous federated

AB In the vehicular network, federated learning is an emerging paradigm to train deep learning models safely. However, the non-identically independent distributed data collected by intelligent connected vehicles, expensive training overhead, and the existence of malicious participants significantly affect the efficiency of training and constrain the development of federated learning in the vehicular network. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a participant selection-based asynchronous federated learning framework for an intelligent connected vehicle platoon. We proposed a platoon-based asynchronous federated learning framework that effectively improves training efficiency through data share and asynchronous optimization. Also, We designed a signaling game-based participant selection strategy that accurately identifies the potentially malicious participants by analyzing the Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium. The comparison experiment result shows the training model using our proposed scheme converges faster than the baseline scheme and gains approximately 10% higher accuracy.

AB Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) has been proposed to address the insufficient labeled data problem by training models with pseudo-labeling. In previous FSSL systems, a single global model is always trained without an equivalent generalization ability for the clients under the non-IID setting. Accordingly, model personalization methods have been proposed to overcome this problem. Intuitively, seeking labeling assistance from other clients with similar data distribution, i.e., model migration, can effectively improve the personalization on the clients with scarce labeled data. However, previous works require to migrate a pre-fixed number of models among the clients, causing unnecessary resource waste and accuracy degradation due to resource heterogeneity. Considering that the number of model migrations and the quality of pseudo-labels have a significant impact on the training performance (e.g., efficiency and accuracy), we propose a novel personalized FSSL system, called Ferrari, to boost the efficiency of pseudo-labeling and training accuracy through adaptive model migrations among the clients. Specifically, Ferrari first generates the similarity-based ranking using a Gaussian KD-Tree, considering the varied data distributions among the clients. Combined with the ranking and clients' heterogeneous resource constraints, Ferrari then adaptively determines the proper model migration policy and confidence thresholds for high-quality pseudo-labeling and personalized training for clients. Extensive experiments on a physical platform show that Ferrari provides a 1.2 similar to 5.5x speedup without sacrificing model accuracy, compared to existing methods.

AB Objective. De-centralized data analysis becomes an increasingly preferred option in the healthcare domain, as it alleviates the need for sharing primary patient data across collaborating institutions. This highlights the need for consistent harmonized data curation, pre-processing, and identification of regions of interest based on uniform criteria. Approach. Towards this end, this manuscript describes the Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) tool, in terms of software architecture and functionality. Main results. The primary aim of the FeTS tool is to facilitate this harmonized processing and the generation of gold standard reference labels for tumor sub-compartments on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and further enable federated training of a tumor sub-compartment delineation model across numerous sites distributed across the globe, without the need to share patient data. Significance. Building upon existing open-source tools such as the Insight Toolkit and Qt, the FeTS tool is designed to enable training deep learning models targeting tumor delineation in either centralized or federated settings. The target audience of the FeTS tool is primarily the computational researcher interested in developing federated learning models, and interested in joining a global federation towards this effort. The tool is open sourced at https://github.com/FETS-AI/Front-End.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a technique that allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their sensitive and bandwidth-hungry data. This paper presents a joint early client termination and local epoch adjustment for FL. We consider the challenges of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) environments including non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data as well as diverse computing and communication capabilities. The goal is to strike the best tradeoff among three conflicting objectives, namely global model accuracy, training latency and communication cost. We first leverage the balanced-MixUp technique to mitigate the influence of non-IID data on the FL convergence rate. A weighted sum optimization problem is then formulated and solved via our proposed FL double deep reinforcement learning (FedDdrl) framework, which outputs a dual action. The former indicates whether a participating FL client is dropped, whereas the latter specifies how long each remaining client needs to complete its local training task. Simulation results show that FedDdrl outperforms the existing FL scheme in terms of overall tradeoff. Specifically, FedDdrl achieves higher model accuracy by about 4% while incurring 30% less latency and communication costs.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a promising distributed learning mechanism that revolutionizes our interaction with data in the IoT ecosystem. Due to the rapidly growing scale of smart devices and the limited transmission resources of networks, a simple, consistent, and scalable FL framework aiming to address the communication bottleneck is urgently needed. In this work, we propose an efficient approach with selective aggregation of models (SAMs) to mitigate the communication overload in FL systems. The introduction of SAM enables each local client to upload its model with a certain probability, resulting in a significant reduction in costly communication expenses. We design the algorithm for SAM, analyze the convergence bound on nonconvex objectives for heterogeneous data, which illustrates the impact of the selection probability as well as the set size of participating clients on the system performance, and assess the conservation for the network resource utilization by modeling queuing systems. We conduct various experiments to evaluate the performance of SAM, whose outcomes suggest that significant alleviation of the communication bottleneck can be accomplished with marginal cost of performance loss. It will also be shown that SAM is a communication-efficient method that can be freely applied to other frameworks.

ID DESIGN
AB Recently, federated learning (FL) has been receiving great attention as an effective machine learning method to avoid the security issue in raw data collection, as well as to distribute the computing load to edge devices. However, even though wireless communication is an essential component for implementing FL in edge networks, there have been few works that analyze the effect of wireless networks on FL. In this paper, we investigate FL in small-cell networks where multiple base stations (BSs) and users are located according to a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) with different densities. We comprehensively analyze the effects of geographic node deployment on the model aggregation in FL on the basis of stochastic geometry-based analysis. We derive the closed-form expressions of coverage probability with tractable approximations and discuss the minimum required BS density for achieving a target model aggregation rate in small-cell networks. Our analysis and simulation results provide insightful information for understanding the behaviors of FL in small-cell networks; these can be exploited as a guideline for designing the network facilitating wireless FL.

DE Federated analytics (FA); federated learning (FL); heterogeneous
   environments; network traffic classification
AB Network traffic classification is the foundation for many network security and network management applications. Recently, to preserve the privacy of the data which are generated in the mobile ends, federated learning (FL)-based classification methods are being proposed. Unfortunately, the performance of FL-based methods can seriously degrade when the client data have skewness. This is particularly true for mobile network traffic classification where the environments in the mobile ends are highly heterogeneous. In this article, we first conduct a measurement study on traffic classification accuracy through FL using real-world network traffic trace and we observe serious accuracy degradation due to heterogeneous environments. We propose a novel federated analytics (FA) approach, FEAT, to improve the accuracy. Note that FL emphasizes on model training, yet our FA performs local analytic tasks that can estimate traffic data skewness and select appropriate clients for FL model training. Our analytics tasks are performed locally and in a federated manner; thus, we preserve privacy as well. Our approach has strong theoretical properties where we exploit Hoeffding inequality to infer traffic data skewness and we leverage the Thompson Sampling for client selection. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments using real-world traffic data sets QUIC and ISCX. The extensive experiments demonstrate that FEAT can improve traffic classification accuracy in heterogeneous environments.

AB Blockchain networks serve as a transparent and secure ledger storage solution, yet they remain vulnerable to attacks. There must be some mechanism to protect the blockchain network from attacks. Among various attacks, the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is considered severe, which is challenging to detect accurately and reliably. Machine learning techniques are used to detect the attack, which requires exploring all global attack data in a single system, which is difficult in practice. This article proposes a distributed machine learning mechanism called Federated Machine Learning for detecting the presence of DDoS attacks. But in federated machine learning the model itself can be poisoned by the malicious collaborating node which is another problem that this article solves by storing the model in blockchain and by introducing a new reputation-based miner selection procedure. The proposed framework integrates the federation of machine learning within the blockchain network framework for detecting DDoS attacks. Under the integrated framework, miners are used to train the blocks and they also participate in the machine learning training. A dynamic reputation-based miner selection mechanism that can balance exploration and exploitation is proposed for optimal miner selection, which can ensure the high accuracy of the machine learning model and improve the security of blockchain from attacks like DDoS attacks and 51% attacks. The proposed framework is tested with Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and Logistic Regression machine learning algorithms. The proposed mechanism achieved maximum accuracy of 99.1% using random forest model which is superior to the existing mechanism of detection of DDoS attacks.

AB Personal identification (PI) can be verified using multimodal vital sign measurement methodologies in human physiology, such as electrocardiography (ECG) and radar signals. However, these processes are inevitably associated with concerns over privacy during the data collection and analysis stages, as well as discomfort during the physical measurement stages. To mitigate these issues, we explored the utilization of federated learning (FL) and noncontact sensors to ensure privacy protection and alleviate contact-related discomfort, respectively. Our objective was to establish the viability of privacy-secured PI models using FL. Furthermore, we examined the performance of FL-based PI models that incorporate non-contact radar signals, comparing the performance levels of five conventional machine learning (ML) models with those of five FL-based models using ECG and radar signals. Our experimental results indicate that although the ECG-based models exhibited superior overall accuracy, their radar-based counterparts demonstrated only slightly lower accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness of FL-based PI models when compared with standard ML models. Thus, our study augments the evolution of privacy-guarded PI processes and lays a robust groundwork for future research in this field.

AB Future sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks are expected to include new features such as the network data analysis function (NWDAF), which will allow network operators to integrate machine learning (ML)-based data analysis techniques into their networks. This will allow NWDAF to identify, safeguard against, and handle various types of anomalous behaviors on user devices. To this end, this study applies fair federated learning (FL) to the 3GPP standard NWDAF architecture and embeds the designed multi-task ML model to detect traffic anomalies in different types of user devices. However, there is a problem of different task demands when the same ML model is used for optimization between different tasks. Therefore, a global alternating gradient projection (AGP) technique is presented in this study. It can be applied to many tasks and utilized to solve minimization problems. The two gradient projection phases comprise each iteration of the AGP. These steps update various tasks at regular intervals, thereby providing a regularized version of the gradient to the original multi-task objective function, which results in optimal task performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-task ML model can simultaneously detect traffic anomalies of different types of user devices in NWDAF and outperforms state-of-the-art models in detecting multi-task anomalies in NWDAF. The experimental evaluation also implied that the designed FL applies superior anomaly detection performance in NWDAF scenarios and has lower communication overhead than that of the traditional NWDAF without affecting the ML performance.

AB This study proposes a short-term traffic flow prediction model that combines community detection-based federated learning with a graph convolutional network (GCN) to alleviate the time-consuming training, higher communication costs, and data privacy risks of global GCNs as the amount of data increases. The federated community GCN (FCGCN) can achieve timely, accurate, and safe traffic state predictions in the era of big traffic data, which is critical for the efficient operation of intelligent transportation systems. The FCGCN prediction process has four steps: dividing the local subnetwork with community detection, local training based on the global parameters, uploading the local model parameters, and constructing a global model prediction based on the aggregated parameters. Numerical results on the PeMS04 and PeMS08 datasets show that the FCGCN outperforms four benchmark models, namely, the long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), ChebNet, and graph attention network (GAT) models. The FCGCN prediction is closer to the real value, with nearly the same performance as the global model at a lower time cost, thus achieving accurate and secure short-term traffic flow predictions with three parameters: flow, speed, and occupancy.

AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) enables computation intensive applications in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to no longer be limited by device resources. However, the lack of an effective task scheduling strategy will seriously affect users' quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, a task type-based task offloading and resource allocation strategy is proposed to reduce delay and energy consumption during task execution. First, we establish communication, computing, and system cost models based on task offloading schemes, and model the joint optimization problem of task offloading and resource allocation as a Markov decision process. The utility function is obtained based on the task completion rate and the system cost. Second, an algorithm framework based on multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) is designed to solve the difficulty that traditional single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms are difficult to converge in a dynamic environment. In distributed scenarios, the proposed framework can also reduce system costs while handling more tasks. Finally, federated learning is introduced in the training process to reduce the impact of non-IID data while protecting privacy. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve system processing efficiency and reduce device energy consumption compared to the popular reinforcement learning algorithms.

AB Federated learning relies on distributed training on mobile device. The previous research mainly focuses on addressing the heterogeneity from computation and data distributions. As battery life remains to be the performance bottleneck on mobile devices, energy consumption from the persistent training tasks poses great challenges. In this paper, we propose an online scheduler to optimize energy usage by leveraging application co-execution and asynchronous gradient updates. Motivated by a series of empirical studies, we find that placing the training process in the background while co-running a foreground application gives the system a large energy discount. Based on these findings, we first study an offline baseline assuming all the application occurrences are known in advance, and propose a dynamic programming solution. Then we propose an online scheduler using the Lyapunov framework to exploit the energy-staleness/slowdown trade-offs and prove the convergence at the rate of $1/\sqrt{K}$1/K. We conduct extensive experiments on a mobile testbed with devices from different vendors. The results indicate 10-30% energy saving and much faster convergence compared to FedAvg and FedProx with 3-4% higher testing accuracy under the non-IID data setting. The design is also validated in terms of resource utilization, memory bandwidth and Frame-Per-Second rates.

AB By exploiting the computing power and local data of distributed clients, federated learning (FL) features ubiquitous properties such as reduction of communication overhead and preserving data privacy. In each communication round of FL, the clients update local models based on their own data and upload their local updates via wireless channels. However, latency caused by hundreds to thousands of communication rounds remains a bottleneck in FL. To minimize the training latency, this work provides a multi-armed bandit-based framework for online client scheduling (CS) in FL without knowing wireless channel state information and statistical characteristics of clients. Firstly, we propose a CS algorithm based on the upper confidence bound policy (CS-UCB) for ideal scenarios where local datasets of clients are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and balanced. An upper bound of the expected performance regret of the proposed CS-UCB algorithm is provided, which indicates that the regret grows logarithmically over communication rounds. Then, to address non-ideal scenarios with non-i.i.d. and unbalanced properties of local datasets and varying availability of clients, we further propose a CS algorithm based on the UCB policy and virtual queue technique (CS-UCB-Q). An upper bound is also derived, which shows that the expected performance regret of the proposed CS-UCB-Q algorithm can have a sub-linear growth over communication rounds under certain conditions. Besides, the convergence performance of FL training is also analyzed. Finally, simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

AB Wind energy is a fast-growing renewable energy but faces blade icing. Data-driven methods provide talented solutions for blade icing detection, but a considerable amount of Internet of Things data needs to be collected to a central server, which may lead to the leakage of sensitive business data. To address this limitation, this article proposes BLADE, a Blockchain-empowered imbalanced federated learning (FL) model for blade icing detection. With the help of the Blockchain, the conventional FL is improved without worrying about the failure of the single centralized server and boosts the privacy preserving. A validation mechanism is introduced into the Blockchain to enhance the defense against poisoning attacks. In addition, a novel imbalanced learning algorithm is integrated into BLADE to solve the class imbalance problem in the sensor data. BLADE is evaluated on ten wind turbines from two wind farms. The experimental results verify the effectiveness, superiority, and feasibility of the proposed BLADE.

AB As a promising distributed machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) trains a central model with decentralized data without compromising user privacy, which makes it widely used by Artificial Intelligence Internet of Things (AIoT) applications. However, the traditional FL suffers from model inaccuracy, since it trains local models only using hard labels of data while useful information of incorrect predictions with small probabilities is ignored. Although various solutions try to tackle the bottleneck of the traditional FL, most of them introduce significant communication overhead, making the deployment of large-scale AIoT devices a great challenge. To address the above problem, this article presents a novel distillation-based FL (DFL) method that enables efficient and accurate FL for AIoT applications. By using knowledge distillation (KD), in each round of FL training, our approach uploads both the soft targets and local model gradients to the cloud server for aggregation, where the aggregation results are then dispatched to AIoT devices for the next round of local training. During the DFL local training, in addition to hard labels, the model predictions approximate soft targets, which can improve model accuracy by leveraging the knowledge of soft targets. To further improve our DFL model performance, we design a dynamic adjustment strategy of loss function weights for tuning the ratio of KD and FL, which can maximize the synergy between soft targets and hard labels. Comprehensive experimental results on well-known benchmarks show that our approach can significantly improve the model accuracy of FL without introducing significant communication overhead.

   edge computing; client selection
AB Federated Learning (FL) has recently attracted considerable attention in internet of things, due to its capability of enabling mobile clients to collaboratively learn a global prediction model without sharing their privacy-sensitive data to the server. Despite its great potential, a main challenge of FL is that the training data are usually non-Independent, Identically Distributed (non-IID) on the clients, which may bring the biases in the model training and cause possible accuracy degradation. To address this issue, this paper aims to propose a novel FL algorithm to alleviate the accuracy degradation caused by non-IID data at clients. Firstly, we observe that the clients with different degrees of non-IID data present heterogeneous weight divergence with the clients owning IID data. Inspired by this, we utilize weight divergence to recognize the non-IID degrees of clients. Then, we propose an efficient FL algorithm, named CSFedAvg, in which the clients with lower degree of non-IID data will be chosen to train the models with higher frequency. Finally, we conduct simulations using publicly-available datasets to train deep neural networks. Simulation results show that the proposed FL algorithm improves the training performance compared with existing FL protocol.

AB The state-of-the-art centralized computing framework applied to the optimal market dispatch of energy storage systems (ESS) aggregates data from local ESS units for training on the cloud server due to the limited computing resources on edge. However, this approach poses several challenges, including the lack of joint optimization for multiple ESS units, susceptibility to single point of failure and attacks, and inadequate data privacy protection for ESS owners. This study proposes an adaptive personalized federated reinforcement learning (FRL) for multipleESS optimal dispatch in various electricity markets with electric vehicle and renewable energy, achieving both the joint optimization of multiple ESSs and avoiding the degraded performance of FRL's local model. Under an adaptively ESS-related differential privacy protection, local devices and the cloud server are specialized to form multiagent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model for bidding energy, regulation, and third-party services and update the global models, respectively. Given the adaptability of personalization layer to different agents and clients, an adaptive personalization method is developed by calculating the number of personalization layers with the relative loss of each agent and client in the iteration process. The case study shows that the adaptive personalized FRL outperforms conventional FRL, DRL and optimization algorithms.

AB Recently, with the establishment of new thermal regulation, the energy efficiency of buildings has increased significantly, and various deep learning-based methods have been presented to accurately forecast the heating load demand of buildings. However, all of these methods are executed on a dataset with specific distribution and do not have the property of global forecasting, and have no guarantee of data privacy against cyber-attacks. This paper presents a novel approach to heating load demand forecasting based on Cyber-Secure Federated Deep Learning (CSFDL). The suggested CSFDL provides a global super-model for forecasting heating load demand of different local clients without knowing their location and, most importantly, without revealing their privacy. In this study, a CSFDL global server is trained and tested considering the heating load demand of 10 different clients in their building environment. The presented results, including a comparative study, prove the viability and accuracy of the proposed procedure.

ID LEARNING CHALLENGES
AB In federated learning, each participant trains its local model with its own data and a global model is formed at a trusted server by aggregating model updates coming from these participants. Since the server has no effect and visibility on the training procedure of the participants to ensure privacy, the global model becomes vulnerable to attacks such as data poisoning and model poisoning. Although many defense algorithms have recently been proposed to address these attacks, they often make strong assumptions that do not agree with the nature of federated learning, such as assuming Non-IID datasets. Moreover, they mostly lack comprehensive experimental analyses. In this work, we propose a defense algorithm called ARFED that does not make any assumptions about data distribution, update similarity of participants, or the ratio of the malicious participants. ARFED mainly considers the outlier status of participant updates for each layer of the model architecture based on the distance to the global model. Hence, the participants that do not have any outlier layer are involved in model aggregation. We have performed extensive experiments on diverse scenarios and shown that the proposed approach provides a robust defense against different attacks. To test the defense capability of the ARFED in different conditions, we considered label flipping, Byzantine, and partial knowledge attacks for both IID and Non-IID settings in our experimental evaluations. Moreover, we proposed a new attack, called organized partial knowledge attack, where malicious participants use their training statistics collaboratively to define a common poisoned model. We have shown that organized partial knowledge attacks are more effective than independent attacks.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Federated learning (FL), as a paradigm for addressing challenges of machine learning (ML) to be applied in private distributed data provides a novel and promising scheme to promote ML in multiple independently distributed healthcare institutions. However, the non-IID and unbalanced nature of the data distribution can decrease its performance, even resulting in the institutions losing motivation to participate in its training. This paper explored the problem with an in-hospital mortality prediction task under an actual multi-center ICU electronic health record database that preserves the original non-IID and unbalanced data distribution. It first analyzed the reason for the performance degradation of baseline FL under this data scenario, and then proposed a personalized FL (PFL) approach named POLA to tackle the problem. POLA is a personalized one-shot and two-step FL method capable of generating high-performance personalized models for each independent participant. The proposed method, POLA was compared with two other PFL methods in experiments, and the results indicate that it not only effectively improves the prediction performance of FL but also significantly reduces the communication rounds. Moreover, its generality and extensibility also make it potential to be extended to other similar cross-silo FL application scenarios.

AB This study introduces a privacy-preserving approach for the real-time action detection in intelligent vehicles using a federated learning (FL)-based temporal recurrent network (TRN). This approach enables edge devices to independently train models, enhancing data privacy and scalability by eliminating central data consolidation. Our FL-based TRN effectively captures temporal dependencies, anticipating future actions with high precision. Extensive testing on the Honda HDD and TVSeries datasets demonstrated robust performance in centralized and decentralized settings, with competitive mean average precision (mAP) scores. The experimental results highlighted that our FL-based TRN achieved an mAP of 40.0% in decentralized settings, closely matching the 40.1% in centralized configurations. Notably, the model excelled in detecting complex driving maneuvers, with mAPs of 80.7% for intersection passing and 78.1% for right turns. These outcomes affirm the model's accuracy in action localization and identification. The system showed significant scalability and adaptability, maintaining robust performance across increased client device counts. The integration of a temporal decoder enabled predictions of future actions up to 2 s ahead, enhancing the responsiveness. Our research advances intelligent vehicle technology, promoting safety and efficiency while maintaining strict privacy standards.

ID CHALLENGES
AB We consider a federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) scenario in heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare systems where only a tiny fraction of IoT healthcare devices possess labels. The challenge is that most IoT devices need label information and exhibit heterogeneous data distributions. This article proposes a unified FSSL framework (FSSL-HD) tailored for IoT healthcare systems with heterogeneous distributions. The FSSL-HD framework introduces a novel objective function for unlabeled healthcare devices to enhance generalization performance and reduce intermodel discrepancies. A straightforward loss-based aggregation mechanism is designed to reinforce distillation from labeled healthcare devices to supervise unlabeled samples. Multiple iterations for labeled devices and dynamically adjusted confidence thresholds are proposed to improve the model performance. Our theoretical analysis of the generalization error in FSSL suggests directions for enhancing performance by improving the self-training capabilities of unlabeled devices and reinforcing the distillation and transfer of supervision signals from labeled devices. Our empirical experiments on the federated benchmark data sets and the medical image data sets show that FSSL-HD surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/baoshengli96/FSSL-HD.

ID EVOLUTIONARY GAME
AB Benefiting from the development of Federated Learning (FL) and distributed communication systems, large-scale intelligent applications become possible. Distributed devices not only provide adequate training data, but also cause privacy leakage and energy consumption. How to optimize the energy consumption in distributed communication systems, while ensuring the privacy of users and model accuracy, has become an urgent challenge. In this paper, we define the FL as a 3 -layer architecture including users, agents and server. In order to find a balance among model training accuracy, privacy -preserving effect, and energy consumption, we design the training process of FL as game models. We use an extensive game tree to analyze the key elements that influence the players ' decisions in the single game, and then find the incentive mechanism that meet the social norms through the repeated game. The experimental results show that the Nash equilibrium we obtained satisfies the laws of reality, and the proposed incentive mechanism can also promote users to submit high -quality data in FL. Following the multiple rounds of play, the incentive mechanism can help all players find the optimal strategies for energy, privacy, and accuracy of FL in distributed communication systems.

AB Federated Learning (FL) combined with Differential Privacy (DP) is widespread in healthcare, finance, and IoT due to its advantages in multi-client data distribution. However, existing FL approaches overlook the differential impact levels among clients and data redundancy issues, resulting in high computational overhead and limited real-time applicability. Additionally, non-independent identical distribution (Non-IID) and imbalanced datasets in multi-clients pose challenges in privacy preservation and model overfitting. Therefore, we propose a balanced weight strategy for multi-stage federated learning against multi-client data skewing, called BM-FL, which involves clients, intermediate trust servers (ITSs), and the central server (CS). First, to protect data privacy, an improved Laplace $\epsilon$epsilon-differential privacy method is employed. Second, a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) called BC-GAN is introduced. It is used to generate realistic fake samples and maintain a balanced proportion of samples across different categories. Then, to make full use of each client's valuable data, we designe a balanced weight strategy. Moreover, extensive experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of BM-FL in efficiently handling classification tasks involving Non-IID and imbalanced datasets while maintaining privacy and security. Furthermore, our method attains superior classification accuracy with fewer training epochs compared to relevant classical algorithms.

AB Due to the rapid rate of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, a conversant and effective strategy must be employed to isolate COVID-19. When it comes to determining the identity of COVID-19, one of the most significant obstacles that researchers must overcome is the rapid propagation of the virus, in addition to the dearth of trustworthy testing models. This problem continues to be the most difficult one for clinicians to deal with. The use of AI in image processing has made the formerly insurmountable challenge of finding COVID-19 situations more manageable. In the real world, there is a problem that has to be handled about the difficulties of sharing data between hospitals while still honoring the privacy concerns of the organizations. When training a global deep learning (DL) model, it is crucial to handle fundamental concerns such as user privacy and collaborative model development. For this study, a novel framework is designed that compiles information from five different databases (several hospitals) and edifies a global model using blockchain-based federated learning (FL). The data is validated through the use of blockchain technology (BCT), and FL trains the model on a global scale while maintaining the secrecy of the organizations. The proposed framework is divided into three parts. First, we provide a method of data normalization that can handle the diversity of data collected from five different sources using several computed tomography (CT) scanners. Second, to categorize COVID-19 patients, we ensemble the capsule network (CapsNet) with incremental extreme learning machines (IELMs). Thirdly, we provide a strategy for interactively training a global model using BCT and FL while maintaining anonymity. Extensive tests employing chest CT scans and a comparison of the classification performance of the proposed model to that of five DL algorithms for predicting COVID-19, while protecting the privacy of the data for a variety of users, were undertaken. Our findings indicate improved effectiveness in identifying COVID-19 patients and achieved an accuracy of 98.99%. Thus, our model provides substantial aid to medical practitioners in their diagnosis of COVID-19.

AB The widespread use of UAVs in smart cities for tasks like traffic monitoring and environmental data collection creates significant privacy and security concerns due to the transmission of sensitive data. Traditional UAV-MEC systems with centralized data processing expose this data to risks like breaches and manipulation, potentially hindering the adoption of these valuable technologies. To address this critical challenge, we propose UBFL, a novel privacy-preserving federated learning mechanism that integrates blockchain technology for secure and efficient data sharing. Unlike traditional methods relying on differential privacy (DP), UBFL employs an adaptive nonlinear encryption function to safeguard the privacy of UAV model updates while maintaining data integrity and accuracy. This innovative approach enables rapid convergence, allowing the base station to efficiently identify and filter out severely compromised UAVs attempting to inject malicious data. Additionally, UBFL incorporates the Random Cut Forest (RCF) anomaly detection algorithm to actively identify and mitigate poisoning data attacks. Extensive comparative experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR10 and Mnist demonstrably showcase UBFL's effectiveness. Compared to DP-based methods, UBFL achieves accuracy (99.98%), precision (99.93%), recall (99.92%), and F-Score (99.92%) in privacy preservation while maintaining superior accuracy. Notably, under data pollution scenarios with varying attack sample rates (10%, 20%, and 30%), UBFL exhibits exceptional resilience, highlighting its robust capabilities in securing UAV gradients within MEC environments.

AB Edge federated learning (EFL) utilizes edge computing (EC) to alleviate direct round communications of multi-dimensional model updates between local participants and the central parameter server. With an elastic edge-assisted aggregation procedure, the burden of backbone congestion can be handled for multi-service model communications. To provide an adaptive virtual resource orchestration, the integration of software-defined networking (SDN), network functions virtualization (NFV), EC, and double deep q-networks is emerged, which accurately gathers the state observation from local and edge nodes in data plane and NFV infrastructure (NFVI) for applying actions of allocated resource predetermination and recommended offloading policy. The reward formulation considers the minimization of completion time, energy consumption, and round communications between local participants and the selected NFV-enabled EC (NFVeEC) node until the global model is constructed with satisfying accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a decentralized SDN controller as an agent to enable a softwarization mechanism and interact with the virtualization-based EFL environment. The architecture adoption, agent controller, and orchestrator allow the centralized view for virtual network functions placement with efficient virtual machine mapping to perform edge update procedures and create the forwarding path effectively. The recommended NFVeEC for local-EFL updates is based on reward output and proposed agent valuation.

AB Federated learning (FL) facilitates collaborative training of a global model without sharing the participants' raw data. Nevertheless, existing FL approaches still face three major issues: 1) How to propose a more efficient and secure privacy-preserving method; 2) How to verify the identity of participants to ensure they are not impersonators; 3) How to reduce the significant communication cost. To address the aforementioned concerns, several schemes have been proposed. However, these schemes suffer from flaws in security, efficiency, and functionality. Furthermore, few researches have considered the possibility of adversaries impersonating legitimate participants to undermine the integrity and availability of the model or launch a free-riding attack. In this paper, we first combine the advantages of secret sharing, Diffie-Hellman key agreement, and functional encryption to develop an authenticable secure multi-party computing algorithm (SDF-ASMC). This algorithm can guarantee the security of transmitted data and provide authentication functionality in the absence of a trusted third party. Moreover, an efficient, secure, and authenticable FL algorithm (ESAFL), which leverages compressed sensing and all-or-nothing transform, is introduced to reduce the transmission and encryption of local gradients. Then, only the final element of the transformed measurements is encrypted by our proposed SDF-ASMC to protect all the measurements. This method effectively improves the efficiency of our algorithm. In addition, ESAFL also tolerates participants' dropout. Security analysis demonstrates that our proposed algorithms can securely aggregate local gradients. Finally, the extensive experiments demonstrate the practical performance of our proposed algorithms.

AB Federated learning has been widely studied and applied to various scenarios, such as financial credit, medical identification, and so on. Under these settings, federated learning protects users from exposing their private data, while cooperatively training a shared machine learning algorithm model (i.e., the global model) for a variety of realworld applications. The only data exchanged is the gradient of the model or the updated model (i.e., the local model update). However, the security of federated learning is increasingly being questioned, due to the malicious clients or central servers constant attack on the global model or user privacy data. To address these security issues, we propose a decentralized federated learning framework based on blockchain, that is, a Block-chain-based Federated Learning framework with Committee consensus (BFLC). Without a centralized server, the framework uses blockchain for the global model storage and the local model update exchange. To enable the proposed BFLC, we also devise an innovative committee consensus mechanism, which can effectively reduce the amount of consensus computing and reduce malicious attacks. We then discuss the scalability of BFLC, including theoretical security, storage optimization, and incentives. Finally, based on a FISCO blockchain system, we perform experiments using an AlexNet model on several frameworks with a real-world dataset FEMNIST. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and security of the BFLC framework.

TI Federated Learning for Personalized Humor Recognition

AB Computational understanding of humor is an important topic under creative language understanding and modeling. It can play a key role in complex human-AI interactions. The challenge here is that human perception of humorous content is highly subjective. The same joke may receive different funniness ratings from different readers. This makes it highly challenging for humor recognition models to achieve personalization in practical scenarios. Existing approaches are generally designed based on the assumption that users have a consensus on whether a given text is humorous or not. Thus, they cannot handle diverse humor preferences well. In this article, we propose the FedHumor approach for the recognition of humorous content in a personalized manner through Federated Learning (FL). Extending a pre-trained language model, FedHumor guides the fine-tuning process by considering diverse distributions of humor preferences from individuals. It incorporates a diversity adaptation strategy into the FL paradigm to train a personalized humor recognition model. To the best of our knowledge, FedHumor is the first text-based personalized humor recognition model through federated learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantage of FedHumor in recognizing humorous texts compared to nine state-of-the-art humor recognition approaches with superior capability for handling the diversity in humor labels produced by users with diverse preferences.

AB This paper considers reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enabled federated learning (FL) system, where the FL users communicate with the access point (AP) via RIS. To reveal the impact of RIS and learning rate on FL aggregation, the theoretical result of minimum global communication rounds and local iteration rounds are derived. Based on the obtained convergence results of FL, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the energy consumption of the proposed RIS-assisted FL system by jointly optimizing the passive beamforming of RIS, the CPU computing frequency, the bandwidth, and the transmit power of users. To solve the non-convex problem, we propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) optimization algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) to decompose the original problem into four sub-problems. Specifically, the closed-form solutions are derived for the CPU frequency, RIS reflection matrix, and communication bandwidth. For the transmit power sub-problem, we propose a linear approximation algorithm based on the first-order Taylor expansion to ensure solution accuracy. Finally, simulation results show that: 1) the energy consumption of the proposed RIS-assisted FL system can be greatly reduced compared to that without optimizing the passive beamforming of RIS and the transmit power; 2) The learning performance of the proposed RIS-enabled FL system is closed to the FL without wireless communication interference; and 3) The proposed algorithm can not only significantly reduce energy consumption, but also fast convergence in terms of the FL model training and testing.

AB Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled multi-access edge computing (MEC) has been introduced as a promising edge paradigm for the future space-aerial-terrestrial integrated communications. Due to the high maneuverability of UAVs, such a flexible paradigm can improve the communication and computation performance for multiple user equipments (UEs). In this paper, we consider the sum power minimization problem by jointly optimizing resource allocation, user association, and power control in an MEC system with multiple UAVs. Since the problem is nonconvex, we propose a centralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm to solve it. However, the centralized method ignores essential issues like distributed framework and privacy concern. We then propose a multi-agent federated reinforcement learning (MAFRL) algorithm in a semi-distributed framework. Meanwhile, we introduce the Gaussian differentials to protect the privacy of all UEs. Simulation results show that the semi-distributed MAFRL algorithm achieves close performances to the centralized MARL algorithm and significantly outperform the benchmark schemes. Moreover, the semi-distributed MAFRL algorithm costs 23% lower opeartion time than the centralized algorithm.

However, due to the limitation of computing resource, it is difficult for end devices to complete complex computing tasks alone. Therefore, this article divides the model into two parts and deploys them on multiple end devices and edges, respectively. Meanwhile, an early exit is set to reduce computing resource overhead, forming a hierarchical distributed architecture. In order to enable the distributed model to continuously evolve by using new data generated by end devices, we comprehensively consider various data distributions on end devices and edges, proposing a hierarchical federated learning framework FLEE, which can realize dynamical updates of models without redeploying them. Through image and sentence classification experiments, we verify that it can improve model performances under all kinds of data distributions, and prove that compared with other frameworks, the models trained by FLEE consume less global computing resource in the inference stage.

AB The diversity of sources and uneven distribution of medical data contributes to the statistical heterogeneity within the Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) networks. In this context, comprehensive analysis of patient data is imperative to provide more precise diagnoses and treatment strategies, rendering personalized medical treatment indispensable. Moreover, the transmission of medical data over networks raises concerns regarding data privacy, necessitating thorough consideration. To address these challenges, we propose FedWFC, a federated learning method that combines a novel importance weight with fuzzy k-means clustering to effectively handle the heterogeneous medical data in MIoT networks. Firstly, we utilize fuzzy k-means for clustering and partitioning local model parameters from MIoT devices, enabling centralized updates of multiple global models based on these clusters. This cluster-centric approach streamlines personalized updates for local models. Secondly, the introduction of the new importance weight allows us to tighten the optimization error bound for global model updates. Experiments show that FedWFC improves the macro F1 score by 4.24% and the micro accuracy by 4.99% compared with existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness in MIoT data processing.

TI AggEnhance: Aggregation Enhancement by Class Interior Points in
   Federated Learning with Non-IID Data
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Federated learning; aggregation enhancement; class interior points;
   non-IID; communication
AB Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving paradigm for multi-institutional collaborations, where the aggregation is an essential procedure after training on the local datasets. Conventional aggregation algorithms often apply a weighted averaging of the updates generated from distributed machines to update the global model. However, while the data distributions are non-IID, the large discrepancy between the local updates might lead to a poor averaged result and a lower convergence speed, i.e., more iterations required to achieve a certain performance. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel method named AggEnhance for enhancing the aggregation, where we synthesize a group of reliable samples from the local models and tune the aggregated result on them. These samples, named class interior points (CIPs) in this work, bound the relevant decision boundaries that ensure the performance of aggregated result. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly design an enhancing method for the aggregation in prevailing FL pipelines. A series of experiments on real data demonstrate that our method has noticeable improvements of the convergence in non-IID scenarios. In particular, our approach reduces the iterations by 31.87% on average for the CIFAR10 dataset and 43.90% for the PASCAL VOC dataset. Since our method does not modify other procedures of FL pipelines, it is easy to apply to most existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, it does not require additional data transmitted from the local clients to the global server, thus holding the same security level as the original FL algorithms.

AB With the rapid deployment of electronic imaging devices, plenty of high-quality images are in the general public's hands. These images can be profitable, such as providing retrieval services; however, it is difficult for the individual to profit without the support of the cloud platform. The straightforward idea is that image owners upload their images to the cloud; yet, it is infeasible as the cloud platforms are not fully-trusted. In previous works, in order to protect the privacy of image owners, many researchers consider the Secure content-based Image Retrieval (SIR) task, which enables cloud servers to provide retrieval services while not exposing the images from the owners. However, the existing schemes are often not friendly to users as it's assumed that the owners have no profit demand and are unwilling to provide extra computation resources. This work introduces federated learning into SIR, which ensures better retrieval accuracy and efficiency; the additive secret sharing technology is utilized to protect the image information, and a better secure comparison protocol is proposed for better efficiency. We believe that the users can enjoy a better secure retrieval service with our proposed scheme. The experiment results and security analysis demonstrate that our scheme provides a significant accuracy advantage while ensuring efficiency and security.

DE Web service; distributed QoS prediction; federated learning;
   hierarchical clustering; deep neural network
AB With the overwhelming explosion of Web services, how to effectively predict unknown QoS has become a key issue of differentiating large-scale similar or functionally equivalent Web services. However, current state-of-the-art QoS prediction approaches based on deep learning still suffer from two deficiencies. First, they mainly focus on predicting vacant QoS in a centralized manner and scarcely take into account distributed QoS prediction, which makes difficult to protect the privacy information of users invoking Web services. Second, they have ignored the hierarchical collaborative relationship to better extract latent features of users and services, reducing the accuracy of QoS prediction. To address these two issues, we propose a novel framework called <bold>F</bold>ederated <bold>H</bold>ierarchical <bold>C</bold>lustering for <bold>D</bold>istributed <bold>Q</bold>oS <bold>P</bold>rediction (FHC-DQP). It collaboratively performs distributed federated training on independent users' QoS invocations, and then the extracted federated users' private features are fed to clustering algorithm for partitioning them into a set of clusters. By iteratively federated hierarchical clustering, users are fine-grained partitioned together and those users within the same cluster have stronger collaborative relevance for more effectively learning the latent features of users and services leading to the performance improvement of distributed QoS prediction, where contextual-aware deep neural network is designed for personalized QoS prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted based on a public real-world benchmarking dataset called WS-DREAM with almost 2,000,000 user-service historical QoS invocations. Compared with both centralized and federated competing baselines, the results demonstrate FHC-DQP receives superior performance for distributed QoS prediction, when it provides privacy-preserving of users' QoS invocations.

AB Communication networks are crucial components of the underlying digital infrastructure in any smart city setup. The increasing usage of computer networks brings additional cyber security concerns, and every organization has to implement preventive measures to protect valuable data and business processes. Due to the inherent distributed nature of the city infrastructures as well as the critical nature of its resources and data, any solution to the attack detection calls for distributed, efficient and privacy preserving solutions. In this paper, we extend the evaluation of our federated learning framework for network attacks detection and classification based on random forest. Previously the framework was evaluated only for attack detection using four well-known intrusion detection datasets (KDD, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS-2017). In this paper, we extend the evaluation for attack classification. We also evaluate how adding differential privacy into random forest, as an additional protective mechanism, affects the framework performances. The results show that the framework outperforms the average performance of independent random forests on clients for both attack detection and classification. Adding differential privacy penalizes the performance of random forest, as expected, but the use of the proposed framework still brings benefits in comparison to the use of independent local models. The code used in this paper is publicly available, to enable transparency and facilitate reproducibility within the research community.

AB Diagnosing multi-stage diseases typically requires doctors to consider multiple data sources, including clinical symptoms, physical signs, biochemical test results, imaging findings, pathological examination data, and even genetic data. When applying machine learning modeling to predict and diagnose multi-stage diseases, several challenges need to be addressed. Firstly, the model needs to handle multimodal data, as the data used by doctors for diagnosis includes image data, natural language data, and structured data. Secondly, privacy of patients' data needs to be protected, as these data contain the most sensitive and private information. Lastly, considering the practicality of the model, the computational requirements should not be too high. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated deep learning diagnostic method for multi-stage diseases. This method improves the forward and backward propagation processes of deep neural network modeling algorithms and introduces a homomorphic encryption step to design a federated modeling algorithm without the need for an arbiter. It also utilizes dedicated integrated circuits to implement the hardware Paillier algorithm, providing accelerated support for homomorphic encryption in modeling. Finally, this paper designs and conducts experiments to evaluate the proposed solution. The experimental results show that in privacy-preserving federated deep learning diagnostic modeling, the method in this paper achieves the same modeling performance as ordinary modeling without privacy protection, and has higher modeling speed compared to similar algorithms.

AB Federated Learning (FL) plays a pivotal role in enabling artificial intelligence (AI)-based mobile applications in mobile edge computing (MEC). However, due to the resource heterogeneity among participating mobile users (MUs), delayed updates from slow MUs may deteriorate the learning speed of the MEC-based FL system, commonly referred to as the straggling problem. To tackle the problem, this work proposes a novel privacy-preserving FL framework that utilizes homomorphic encryption (HE) based solutions to enable MUs, particularly resource-constrained MUs, to securely offload part of their training tasks to the cloud server (CS) and mobile edge nodes (MENs). Our framework first develops an efficient method for packing batches of training data into HE ciphertexts to reduce the complexity of HE-encrypted training at the MENs/CS. On that basis, the mobile service provider (MSP) can incentivize straggling MUs to encrypt part of their local datasets that are uploaded to certain MENs or the CS for caching and remote training. However, caching a large amount of encrypted data at the MENs and CS for FL may not only overburden those nodes but also incur a prohibitive cost of remote training, which ultimately reduces the MSP's overall profit. To optimize the portion of MUs' data to be encrypted, cached, and trained at the MENs/CS, we formulate an MSP's profit maximization problem, considering all MUs' and MENs' resource capabilities and data handling costs (including encryption, caching, and training) as well as the MSP's incentive budget. We then show that the problem is convex and can be efficiently solved using an interior point method. Extensive simulations on a real-world human activity recognition dataset show that our proposed framework can achieve much higher model accuracy (improving up to 24.29%) and faster convergence rate (by 2.86 times) than those of the conventional FedAvg approach when the straggling probability varies between 20% and 80%. Moreover, the proposed framework can improve the MSP's profit up to 2.84 times compared with other baseline FL approaches without MEN-assisted training.

AB Federated edge learning (FEEL) is a widely adopted framework for training an artificial intelligence (AI) model distributively at edge devices to leverage their data while preserving their data privacy. The execution of a power-hungry learning task at energy-constrained devices is a key challenge confronting the implementation of FEEL. To tackle the challenge, we propose the solution of powering devices using wireless power transfer (WPT). To derive guidelines on deploying the resultant wirelessly powered FEEL (WP-FEEL) system, this work aims at the derivation of the tradeoff between the model convergence and the settings of power sources in two scenarios: 1) the transmission power and density of power-beacons (dedicated charging stations) if they are deployed, or otherwise 2) the transmission power of a server (access-point). The development of the proposed analytical framework relates the accuracy of distributed stochastic-gradient estimation to the WPT settings, the randomness in both communication and WPT links, and devices' computation capacities. Furthermore, the local-computation at devices (i.e., mini-batch size and processor clock frequency) is optimized to efficiently use the harvested energy for gradient estimation. The resultant learning-WPT tradeoffs reveal the simple scaling laws of the model-convergence rate with respect to the transferred energy as well as the devices' computational energy efficiencies. The results provide useful guidelines on WPT provisioning to yield a guaranteer on learning performance. They are corroborated by experimental results using a real dataset.

AB The existing transmission line detection technologies based on cloud computing are faced with the problems such as low response speed, high communication cost, and difficulty in obtaining scattered data. This article proposes a transmission line defect detection method based on adaptive federated learning (FL), which can adaptively change the data volume of the next training round according to the training energy consumption of each round. As a result, the proposed method can achieve the optimal number of communication between local training cost and global communication efficiency, which greatly improves the training speed and reduces the communication cost. Furthermore, a lightweight Mask region-convolutional neural network (R-CNN) that adopts the MobileNet architecture to replace the original network is designed for the edge, which reduces the required number of parameters and improves the detection speed. The experimental results show that the model training efficiency of the proposed adaptive FL is 70% higher than the centralized cloud computing, and the computing cost is saved by about 40%. Compared with the original Mask R-CNN, the proposed lightweight Mask R-CNN model can achieve 1.1% higher precision, 10% shorter training time, and 40% faster detection speed.

AB Federated learning (FL) over resource-constrained wireless networks has recently attracted much attention. However, most existing studies consider one FL task in single-cell wireless networks and ignore the impact of downlink/uplink inter-cell interference on the learning performance. In this paper, we investigate FL over a multi-cell wireless network, where each cell performs a different FL task and over-the-air computation (AirComp) is adopted to enable fast uplink gradient aggregation. We conduct convergence analysis of AirComp-assisted FL systems, taking into account the inter-cell interference in both the downlink and uplink model/gradient transmissions, which reveals that the distorted model/gradient exchanges induce a gap to hinder the convergence of FL. We characterize the Pareto boundary of the error-induced gap region to quantify the learning performance trade-off among different FL tasks, based on which we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the sum of error-induced gaps in all cells. To tackle the coupling between the downlink and uplink transmissions as well as the coupling among multiple cells, we propose a cooperative multi-cell FL optimization framework to achieve efficient interference management for downlink and uplink transmission design. Results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves much better average learning performance over multiple cells than non-cooperative baseline schemes.

AB Privacy preservation in federated learning (FL) has received considerable attention and many approaches have been proposed. However, these approaches rendered the uploaded gradients invisible to the server, which poses a significant challenge in defending against poisoning attacks. In poisoning attacks, malicious or compromised participants use poisoned training data or forged local updates to disrupt the training process. It is hard for cloud servers to defend against poisoning attacks due to the invisibility of gradients. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-preserving FL scheme (PFLS) against poisoning attacks to eliminate the impact of model poisoning attacks while protecting the privacy of participants. Specifically, a dynamic adaptive defense mechanism is designed to mitigate the impact of malicious gradients and locate malicious participants. To protect participants' privacy, a multidimensional homomorphic encryption method is constructed with a hierarchical aggregation architecture. The security analysis illustrates that the PFLS scheme can ensure the privacy of FL participants. The experimental results demonstrate that a high-detection rate of malicious participants and a balance between efficiency and robustness are achieved.

AB Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) has emerged as a communication-efficient solution to enable distributed machine learning over edge devices by using their data locally to preserve the privacy. By exploiting the waveform superposition property of wireless channels, Air-FEEL allows the "one-shot" over-the-air aggregation of gradient-updates to enhance the communication efficiency, but at the cost of a compromised learning performance due to the aggregation errors caused by channel fading and noise. This paper investigates the transmission power control to combat against such aggregation errors in Air-FEEL. Different from conventional power control designs (e.g., to minimize the individual mean squared error (MSE) of the over-the-air aggregation at each round), we consider a new power control design aiming at directly maximizing the convergence speed. Towards this end, we first analyze the convergence behavior of Air-FEEL (in terms of the optimality gap) subject to aggregation errors at different communication rounds. It is revealed that if the aggregation estimates are unbiased, then the training algorithm would converge exactly to the optimal point with mild conditions; while if they are biased, then the algorithm would converge with an error floor determined by the accumulated estimate bias over communication rounds. Next, building upon the convergence results, we optimize the power control to directly minimize the derived optimality gaps under the cases without and with unbiased aggregation constraints, subject to a set of average and maximum power constraints at individual edge devices. We transform both problems into convex forms, and obtain their structured optimal solutions, both appearing in a form of regularized channel inversion, by using the Lagrangian duality method. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed power control policies achieve significantly faster convergence for Air-FEEL, as compared with benchmark policies with fixed power transmission or conventional MSE minimization.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) nowadays are developing rapidly for various applications such as UAV taxis and delivery drones. However, the limited battery energy restricts the flight distance of the UAVs. Thus, urban prosumers equipped with drone recharge stations are introduced to provide charging services for the UAVs. In this article, first, a day-ahead energy scheduling problem for UAV charging-enabled urban prosumers is studied, where the objective is to maximize the overall energy satisfaction of the prosumers with ensuring the Quality of Service (QoS) of the charged UAVs. Specifically, to deal with the considered problem, we decompose it into two stages: 1) the day-ahead energy requirement data prediction stage and 2) energy scheduling stage per prosumer. Thus, second, a joint method based on hierarchical federated learning (HFL) on long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture (HFL-LSTM) and stochastic game-based multi-agent double deep $Q$ -learning (MADDQN) with community agent-independent approach is proposed. In particular, the HFL-LSTM approach is leveraged to forecast each prosumer's energy requirement data without centralized collecting local prosumers' data such that to protect data privacy. Then, the stochastic game is adopted to analyze the formulated problem, aiming to find the Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy. Afterward, MADDQN with a community agent-independent method is utilized to achieve the best energy scheduling strategy per prosumer. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed joint method that can achieve the lowest mean squared error with the value of 0.0152 and the highest energy satisfaction $(36388)$ achieved by the NE policy compared with the benchmarks.

AB Disaster classification and victim detection are two important tasks in enabling efficient rescue operations. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) model which accomplishes these two tasks simultaneously. The idea is to attach one pruned head model to another backbone network. We mathematically pinpoint the optimal branching location and the depth of the pruned head model. Apart from the decoupled task training capability, the MTL model offers lesser memory requirements (12.8 MB saving) and better disaster classification accuracy (1-2% gain), while preserving the same detection performance (0.694 of average precision (AP)), as compared to the traditional method. Such advantages of flexibility, speed and accuracy facilitate the large-scale deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where we explore the potential of federated learning (FL) and active learning (AL). Given the high ambiguity within disaster images, a modified version of AL-based technique is introduced. For realistic implementation, production-ready OpenFL and OpenVINO tools are adopted to update the global FL model and to optimize the trained model, respectively. Experiment results are promising: the FL-based techniques are comparable to or better than their centralized learning (CL) counterparts. Also, our application portability is demonstrated via different hardware such as CPU and Raspberry Pi.

AB This paper presents a three-stage optimization mechanism designed to enhance Federated Learning (FL) in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. Traditional FL optimizations, which typically focus on a single aspect, fall short in IIoT environments. Our approach integrates a multi-criteria enhancement: first, an Ensembled Client Selection Mechanism (ECSM) selects participants based on accuracy, reputation, and randomness. Second, Adaptive Distributed Client Training (ADCT) dynamically adjusts based on participant performance. Lastly, a Secure and Efficient Communication Channel (SECC), backed by blockchain, meets IIoT's stringent security demands. The evaluation shows TSFed outperforms baseline methods, enhancing FL performance by increasing accuracy and F1-score. Importantly, TSFed improves the efficiency of achieving 80% accuracy on the MNIST dataset by 29.09% over baseline methods, showcasing significant gains in both security and efficiency. This mechanism also exhibits robustness against malicious attacks, setting a new benchmark for FL in IIoT environments.

ID DETECTION SYSTEM
AB The widespread adoption of consumer electronics devices coupled with the emergence of 6G technology has led to the establishment of an extensive network of interconnected devices, forming the underlying infrastructure of the Internet of Things (IoT). Nevertheless, this interconnectivity introduces a myriad of security concerns, given that these devices become susceptible to malicious activities and unauthorized breaches. Moreover, conventional intrusion detection systems encounter difficulties in managing imbalanced data scenarios, wherein the count of normal instances vastly exceeds that of intrusion instances. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for 6G-enabled consumer electronics device intrusion detection, leveraging the power of federated meta-learning and digital twins within a Meta-Verse environment. By leveraging the distributed intelligence of meta-learning across a network of devices, our framework enables efficient and accurate detection of intrusions while mitigating the impact of imbalanced data. Furthermore, by utilizing digital twins within a Meta-Verse environment, we create a scalable and controlled setting for experimentation, enabling the development and evaluation of intrusion detection algorithms in a realistic yet controlled manner. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in detecting intrusions on 6G-enabled consumer electronics devices. The federated meta-learning approach achieves superior performance compared to traditional intrusion detection methods, especially in imbalanced data scenarios.

AB As an emerging distributed learning framework, federated edge learning (FEEL) can efficaciously resolve the delay requirements and privacy concerns by enabling collaborative modeling among the edge devices under the premise of data localization. However, the communication bottlenecks, e.g., model damage and signal deviation, will critically diminish the convergence performance due to the restricted resources and the undesirable wireless fading. To overcome this challenge, one feasible way is to integrate the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into the FEEL system, to reinforce the communication quality by adaptively reconfiguring the signal propagation environment. However, the significant premise to effectively exploit the RIS in most of the prior works is the estimation of exact instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which is extremely thorny and potentially incurs additional communication overhead. To tackle this issue, we investigate in this paper the RIS-aided FEEL system under the realistic supposition where only the statistical CSI is available among devices. Specifically, considering the wireless outage caused by the uncertainty of non-line-of-sight components, we rigorously derive an explicit convergence upper bound of the RIS enabled FEEL framework with outage. Accordingly, a resource configuration problem with the goal of minimizing the sum of outage-probability is further formulated by jointly configuring the RIS configuration matrix and the bandwidth allocation. To seek the solutions, we carefully design a general Bernstein-Type inequality in this paper, and thus the probabilistic outage objective function can be effectively handled in an equivalent manner. Simulation experiments verify that our design can accomplish a significant promotion compared against state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Proactive edge association is capable of improving wireless connectivity at the cost of increased handover (HO) frequency and energy consumption, while relying on a large amount of private information sharing required for decision making. In order to improve the connectivity-cost trade-off without privacy leakage, we investigate the privacy-preserving joint edge association and power allocation (JEAPA) problem in the face of the environmental uncertainty and the infeasibility of individual learning. Upon modelling the problem by a decentralized partially observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP), it is solved by federated multi-agent reinforcement learning (FMARL) through only sharing encrypted training data for federatively learning the policy sought. Our simulation results show that the proposed solution strikes a compelling trade-off, while preserving a higher privacy level than the state-of-the-art solutions.

AB The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and cloud-computing applications over siloed data centers is motivating renewed interest in the collaborative training of a shared model by multiple individual clients via federated learning (FL). To improve the communication efficiency of FL implementations in wireless systems, recent works have proposed compression and dimension reduction mechanisms, along with digital and analog transmission schemes that account for channel noise, fading, and interference. The prior art has mainly focused on star topologies consisting of distributed clients and a central server. In contrast, this paper studies FL over wireless device-to-device (D2D) networks by providing theoretical insights into the performance of digital and analog implementations of decentralized stochastic gradient descent (DSGD). First, we introduce generic digital and analog wireless implementations of communication-efficient DSGD algorithms, leveraging random linear coding (RLC) for compression and over-the-air computation (AirComp) for simultaneous analog transmissions. Next, under the assumptions of convexity and connectivity, we provide convergence bounds for both implementations. The results demonstrate the dependence of the optimality gap on the connectivity and on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels in the network. The analysis is corroborated by experiments on an image-classification task.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB The sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks are envisioned to build a data-driven digital world with widespread Artificial Intelligence (AI). Federated learning (FL) is a distributed AI paradigm that coordinates different data owners to train shared AI models cooperatively. However, traditional FL faces challenges in practically deploying in 6G networks: (i) the central server becomes the bottleneck and fails to identify clients' malicious behaviors, and (ii) the lack of incentive mechanisms makes heterogeneous nodes hard to collaborate when considering unilateral returns. To address the above challenges, we first propose a blockchain-enabled FL (BFL) framework where clients' malicious behaviors could be identified without a central server. Then we propose a Bayesian game-driven incentive mechanism to encourage honest nodes to provide valid models while hindering the training interference from malicious clients. Moreover, we propose a dynamic data contribution scheme to schedule data resources equitably while ensuring model performance. Finally, a Proof-of-Incentive consensus mechanism is designed as benign impetuses to guide the system toward the direction of more secure model aggregation and higher incentives. Experimental results show that our proposed schemes can obtain high-precision models even with malicious clients and effectively motivate honest nodes to join FL in 6G networks.

AB For distributed learning among collaborative users, this paper develops and analyzes a communication-efficient scheme for federated learning (FL) over the air, which incorporates 1-bit compressive sensing (CS) into analog-aggregation transmissions. To facilitate design parameter optimization, we analyze the efficacy of the proposed scheme by deriving a closed-form expression for the expected convergence rate. Our theoretical results unveil the tradeoff between convergence performance and communication efficiency as a result of the aggregation errors caused by sparsification, dimension reduction, quantization, signal reconstruction and noise. Then, we formulate a joint optimization problem to mitigate the impact of these aggregation errors through joint optimal design of worker scheduling and power scaling policy. An enumeration-based method is proposed to solve this non-convex problem, which is optimal but becomes computationally infeasible as the number of devices increases. For scalable computing, we resort to the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) technique to develop an efficient implementation that is suitable for large-scale networks. Simulation results show that our proposed 1-bit CS based FL over the air achieves comparable performance to the ideal case where conventional FL without compression and quantification is applied over error-free aggregation, at much reduced communication overhead and transmission latency.

AB This article proposesa novel federated reinforcement learning (FRL) approach for the energy management of multiple smart homes with home appliances, a solar photovoltaic system, and an energy storage system. The novelty of the proposed FRL approach lies in the development of a distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model that consists of local home energy management systems (LHEMSs) and a global server (GS). Using energy consumption data, DRL agents for LHEMSs construct and upload their local models to the GS. Then, the GS aggregates the local models to update a global model for LHEMSs and broadcasts it to the DRL agents. Finally, the DRL agents replace the previous local models with the global model and iteratively reconstruct their local models. Simulation results obtained under heterogeneous home environments indicate the advantage of the proposed approach in terms of convergence speed, appliance energy consumption, and number of agents.

AB There is a growing interest in the wireless communications community to complement the traditional model-driven design approaches with data-driven machine learning (ML)-based solutions. While conventional ML approaches rely on the assumption of having the data and processing heads in a central entity, this is not always feasible in wireless communications applications because of the inaccessibility of private data and large communication overhead required to transmit raw data to central ML processors. As a result, decentralized ML approaches that keep the data where it is generated are much more appealing. Due to its privacy-preserving nature, federated learning is particularly relevant for many wireless applications, especially in the context of fifth generation (5G) networks. In this article, we provide an accessible introduction to the general idea of federated learning, discuss several possible applications in 5G networks, and describe key technical challenges and open problems for future research on federated learning in the context of wireless communications.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for participants' collaborative learning tasks with cross-silo data. Participants benefit from FL since heterogeneous data can contribute to the generalization of the global model while keeping private data locally. However, practical issues of FL, such as security and fairness, keep emerging, impeding its further development. One of the most threatening security issues is the poisoning attack, corrupting the global model by an adversary's will. Recent studies have demonstrated that elaborate model poisoning attacks can breach the existing Byzantine-robust FL solutions. Although various defenses have been proposed to mitigate poisoning attacks, participants will sacrifice learning performance and fairness due to strict regulations. Considering that the importance of fairness is no less than security, it is crucial to explore alternative solutions that can secure FL while ensuring both robustness and fairness. This paper introduces a robust and fair model aggregation solution, Romoa-AFL, for cross-silo FL in an agnostic data setting. Unlike a previous study named Romoa and other similarity-based solutions, Romoa-AFL ensures robustness against poisoning attacks and learning fairness in agnostic FL, which has no assumptions of participants' data distributions and the server's auxiliary dataset.

AB Full leverage of the huge volume of data generated on a large number of user devices for providing intelligent services in the 6G network calls for Ubiquitous Intelligence (UI). A key to developing UI lies in the involvement of the large number of network devices, which contribute their data to collaborative Machine Learning (ML) and provide their computational resources to support the learning process. Federated Learning (FL) is a new ML method that enables data owners to collaborate in model training without exposing private data, which allows user devices to contribute their data to developing UI. Edge computing deploys cloud-like capabilities at the network edge, which enables network devices to offer their computational resources for supporting FL. Therefore, a combination of FL and edge computing may greatly facilitate the development of ubiquitous intelligence in the 6G network. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of the recent developments in technologies for combining FL and edge computing with a holistic vision across the fields of FL and edge computing. We conduct our survey from both the perspective of an FL framework deployed in an edge computing environment (FL in Edge) and the perspective of an edge computing system providing a platform for FL (Edge for FL). From the FL in Edge perspective, we first identify the main challenges to FL in edge computing and then survey the representative technical strategies for addressing the challenges. From the Edge for FL perspective, we first analyze the key requirements for edge computing to support FL and then review the recent advances in edge computing technologies that may be exploited to meet the requirements. Then we discuss open problems and identify some possible directions for future research on combining FL and edge computing, with the hope of arousing the research community's interest in this emerging and exciting interdisciplinary field.

AB Extensive research is underway to meet the hyperconnectivity demands of 6G networks, driven by applications like XR/VR and holographic communications, which generate substantial data requiring network-based processing, transmission, and analysis. However, adhering to diverse data privacy and security policies in the anticipated multi-domain, multitenancy scenarios of 6G presents a significant challenge. Federated Analytics (FA) emerges as a promising distributed computing paradigm, enabling collaborative data value generation while preserving privacy and reducing communication overhead. Using big data principles, FA can be applied to manage and secure distributed heterogeneous networks, improving performance, reliability, visibility, and security without compromising data confidentiality. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of potential FA applications, domains, and types in 6G networks, elucidating analysis methods, techniques, and queries. It explores complementary approaches to enhance privacy and security in 6G networks alongside FA and discusses the challenges and prerequisites for successful FA implementation. Additionally, distinctions between FA and Federated Learning are drawn, highlighting their synergistic potential through a network orchestration scenario.

AB Federated Edge Learning (FEL) enables a massive number of edge devices (e.g. smart phones) to train machine learning models collaboratively. Due to the inherent unreliability of participating edge devices and the unpredictable network conditions, the final model accuracy is largely determined by the communication time between edge devices and the parameter server (PS). However, there exists very limited work to quantify the influence of the communication time in FEL and show how to minimize its negative impacts from a theoretic perspective. In this paper, we are among the first to develop a formal model of the communication time in FEL and its influence on the final model accuracy. In our work, the set of edge devices involved in each global iteration is defined as the ECP (Engaged Client Pool). We model the communication time cost as a function with respect to the response time distribution of individual devices and the ECP size. By incorporating communication time cost into the convergence rate analysis, we propose the ECPA and H-ECPA algorithms to automatically adjust the size of the ECP so as to maximize the model accuracy in both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. We also analyze how the tail shape of response time affects the convergence rate, and prove that the heavy tail shape can significantly lower the model accuracy. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments with real datasets, and the results confirm the correctness of our analysis and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms.

AB Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is a promising technology for supporting computation-intensive vehicular applications with low latency at the network edges. Vehicles offload their tasks to VEC servers (VECSs) to improve the quality of service (QoS) of the applications. However, the high density of vehicles and VECSs and the mobility of vehicles increase channel interference and deteriorate the channel condition, resulting in increased power consumption and latency. Therefore, we proposed a task offloading method with the power control considering dynamic channel interference and conditions in a vehicular environment. The objective is to maximize the throughput of a VEC system under the power constraints of a vehicle. We leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to achieve superior performance in complex environments and high-dimensional inputs. However, most conventional methods adopted the multi-agent DRL approach that makes decisions using only local information, which can result in poor performance, while single-agent DRL approaches require excessive data exchanges because data needs to be concentrated in an agent. To address these challenges, we adopt a federated deep reinforcement learning (FL) method that combines centralized and distributed approaches to the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) framework. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and performance of the proposed method in terms of the throughput and queueing delay of vehicles in dynamic vehicular networks.

TI IDAC: Federated Learning-Based Intrusion Detection Using Autonomously

SO SENSORS

AB The recent rapid growth in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies is enriching our daily lives but significant information security risks in IoT fields have become apparent. In fact, there have been large-scale botnet attacks that exploit undiscovered vulnerabilities, known as zero-day attacks. Several intrusion detection methods based on network traffic monitoring have been proposed to address this issue. These methods employ federated learning to share learned attack information among multiple IoT networks, aiming to improve collective detection capabilities against attacks including zero-day attacks. Although their ability to detect zero-day attacks with high precision has been confirmed, challenges such as autonomous labeling of attacks from traffic information and attack information sharing between different device types still remain. To resolve the issues, this paper proposes IDAC, a novel intrusion detection method with autonomous attack candidate labeling and federated learning-based attack candidate sharing. The labeling of attack candidates in IDAC is executed using information autonomously extracted from traffic information, and the labeling can also be applied to zero-day attacks. The federated learning-based attack candidate sharing enables candidate aggregation from multiple networks, and it executes attack determination based on the aggregated similar candidates. Performance evaluations demonstrated that IDS with IDAC within networks based on attack candidates is feasible and achieved comparable detection performance against multiple attacks including zero-day attacks compared to the existing methods while suppressing false positives in the extraction of attack candidates. In addition, the sharing of autonomously extracted attack candidates from multiple networks improves both detection performance and the required time for attack detection.

AB Healthcare professionals consider predicting heart disease an essential task and deep learning has proven to be a promising approach for achieving this goal. This research paper introduces a novel method called the asynchronous federated deep learning approach for cardiac prediction (AFLCP), which combines a heart disease dataset and deep neural networks (DNNs) with an asynchronous learning technique. The proposed approach employs a method for asynchronously updating the parameters of DNNs and incorporates a temporally weighted aggregation technique to enhance the accuracy and convergence of the central model. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed AFLCP method, two datasets with various DNN architectures are tested, and the results demonstrate that the AFLCP approach outperforms the baseline method in terms of both communication cost and model accuracy.

AB We study collaborative machine learning systems where a massive dataset is distributed across independent workers which compute their local gradient estimates based on their own datasets. Workers send their estimates through a multipath fading multiple access channel with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing to mitigate the frequency selectivity of the channel. We assume that there is no channel state information (CSI) at the workers, and the parameter server (PS) employs multiple antennas to align the received signals. To reduce the power consumption and the hardware costs, we employ complex-valued low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), at the transmitter and the receiver sides, respectively, and study the effects of practical low-cost DACs and ADCs on the learning performance. Our theoretical analysis shows that the impairments caused by low-resolution DACs and ADCs, including those of one-bit DACs and ADCs, do not prevent the convergence of the federated learning algorithms, and the multipath channel effects vanish when a sufficient number of antennas are used at the PS. We also validate our theoretical results via simulations, and demonstrate that using low-resolution, even one-bit, DACs and ADCs causes only a slight decrease in the learning accuracy.

AB Federated Learning (FL), which enables multiple clients to cooperatively train global models without revealing private data, has gained significant attention from researchers in recent years. However, the data samples on each participating device in FL are often not independent and identically distributed (IID), leading to significant statistical heterogeneity challenges. In this paper, we propose FL-Enhance, a novel framework to address the non-IID-ness data issue in FL by leveraging established solutions such as data selection, data compression, and data augmentation. FL-Enhance, specifically, utilizes cGANs that are trained locally on the server level, which represents a relatively novel approach within the FL framework. Also, data compression techniques are applied to preserve privacy during data sharing between clients and servers. We compare our framework with the commonly used SMOTE data augmentation technique and test it with different FL algorithms, including FedAvg, FedNova, and FedOpt. We conducted experiments using both image and tabular data to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The experimental findings show that FL-Enhance can substantially enhance the performance of the trained models in situations of severe pathological clients while still preserving privacy, which is the fundamental requirement in the FL context.

AB In this paper, we propose a new comprehensive realistic cyber security dataset of IoT and IIoT applications, called Edge-IIoTset, which can be used by machine learning-based intrusion detection systems in two different modes, namely, centralized and federated learning. Specifically, the dataset has been generated using a purpose-built IoT/IIoT testbed with a large representative set of devices, sensors, protocols and cloud/edge configurations. The IoT data are generated from various IoT devices (more than 10 types) such as Low-cost digital sensors for sensing temperature and humidity, Ultrasonic sensor, Water level detection sensor, pH Sensor Meter, Soil Moisture sensor, Heart Rate Sensor, Flame Sensor, etc.). Furthermore, we identify and analyze fourteen attacks related to IoT and IIoT connectivity protocols, which are categorized into five threats, including, DoS/DDoS attacks, Information gathering, Man in the middle attacks, Injection attacks, and Malware attacks. In addition, we extract features obtained from different sources, including alerts, system resources, logs, network traffic, and propose new 61 features with high correlations from 1176 found features. After processing and analyzing the proposed realistic cyber security dataset, we provide a primary exploratory data analysis and evaluate the performance of machine learning approaches (i.e., traditional machine learning as well as deep learning) in both centralized and federated learning modes. The Edge-IIoTset dataset can be publicly accessed from http://ieee-dataport.org/8939.

AB The air quality is a topic of extreme concern that attracts a lot of attention in the world. Many intel-ligent air quality monitoring networks have been deployed in various places, especially in big cities. These monitoring networks collect air quality data with some missing data for some reasons which pose an obstacle for air quality publishing and studies. Generative adversarial nets (GAN) methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in missing data imputation. GAN-based imputation method needs enough training data while one monitoring network has just a few and poor quality monitoring data and these data sets do not meet the independent identical distribution (IID) condition. Therefore, one monitoring network side needs to utilize more monitoring data from other sides as far as possible. However, in the real world, these air quality monitoring networks are owned by different organizations - companies, the government even some secret units. Many of them cannot share detailed monitoring data due to security, privacy, and industrial competition. In this paper, it is the first time to propose a conditional GAN imputation method under a federated learning framework to solve the data sets that come from diverse data-owners without sharing. Furthermore, we improve the vanilla conditional GAN performance with Wasserstein distance and "Hint mask"trick. The experimental results show that our GAN-based imputation methods can achieve the best performance. And our federated GAN imputation method outperforms the GAN imputation method trained locally for each participant which means our imputation model can work. Our proposed federated GAN method can benefit model quality by increasing access to air quality data through private multi-institutional collaborations. We further investigate the effects of data geographical distribution across collaborating participants on model quality and, interestingly, we find that the GAN training process with a federated learning framework performs more stable.

AB 6G will be the next horizon from connected people and things to intelligence-of-everything. Machine learning (ML) combines artificial intelligence with vehicular edge computing (VEC), further releasing the potential of data. Federated learning (FL) is used to manage the collaborative training of vehicular clients and the road side unit (RSU), which can efficiently complete the distributed data processing. However, the vehicular clients upload a large number of model parameters to occupy regular communication resources, and the stability of the link cannot be guaranteed due to the mobility of the vehicles, which may lead to expensive communication overhead in VEC. Thus, this paper proposes a communication-efficient federated double distillation (FedDD) framework, which comprehensively considers the three-dimensional attributes of the vehicles and dynamically selects the cluster-heads (CHs) to improve the transmission efficiency. Then, knowledge distillation is further integrated into the federated learning to accomplish multiple rounds of parameter distillation, thereby significantly reducing the communication overhead. Experimental results show that compared to traditional FedAvg, FedDD can reduce communication overhead by three orders of magnitude. The communication overhead of FedDD is reduced by 82% compared to FTTQ, which improves the communication efficiency of FL while sacrificing a small amount of accuracy.

AB Federated edge learning is envisioned as the bedrock of enabling intelligence in next-generation wireless networks, but the limited spectral resources often constrain its scalability. In light of this challenge, a line of recent research suggested integrating analog over-the-air computations into federated edge learning systems, to exploit the superposition property of electromagnetic waves for fast aggregation of intermediate parameters and achieve (almost) unlimited scalability. Over-the-air computations also benefit the system in other aspects, such as low hardware cost, reduced access latency, and enhanced privacy protection. Despite these advantages, the interference introduced by wireless communications also influences various aspects of the model training process, while its importance is not well recognized yet. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the positive and negative effects of interference on over-the-air computation-based edge learning systems. The potential open issues and research trends are also discussed.

AB With the fast development of modern networking technologies, the transmission rate and reliability of wireless networks have been greatly improved. Meanwhile, the fast-developing Internet of Things (IoT) devices provide continually increasing computation capability. Federated learning (FL) was proposed to leverage communication and computation resources to perform machine learning (ML) tasks on IoT devices. In wireless FL systems, devices train ML models with local data sets, and a base station (BS) aggregates these trained models so that data privacy is guaranteed by the isolation of data sets. However, in the existing works, the same global model is transmitted to devices individually over the wireless channel multiple times, while the updated local models are received only by the BS, which ignores the wireless broadcast channel, incurs large communication overhead, and slows down the overall training process. In this article, we propose the FedBroadcast protocol to efficiently exploit the shared wireless broadcast channel for the two-way model transmission in FL. In the downloading step, we let BS broadcast the global model once for all scheduled devices, and design a dynamic programming-based algorithm to schedule devices optimally. In the uploading step, we also leverage the wireless broadcast channel and select some devices to receive all the updated local models without waiting for model downloading in the next round. Finally, to solve the potential block-cyclic sampling problem brought by device scheduling, we adopt pluralistic averaging modification, which improves the convergence performance under extreme data distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedBroadcast outperforms the existing wireless FL under different system settings.

AB In the era of data-driven healthcare, the amalgamation of blockchain and federated learning (FL) introduces a paradigm shift toward secure, collaborative, and patient-centric data sharing. This article pioneers the exploration of the conceptual framework and technical synergy of FL and blockchain for decentralized data sharing, aiming to strike a balance between data utility and privacy. FL, a decentralized machine learning paradigm, enables collaborative AI model training across multiple healthcare institutions without sharing raw patient data. Combined with blockchain, a transparent and immutable ledger, it establishes an ecosystem fostering trust, security, and data integrity. This article elucidates the technical foundations of FL and blockchain, unravelling their roles in reshaping healthcare data sharing. This article vividly illustrates the potential impact of this fusion on patient care. The proposed approach preserves patient privacy while granting healthcare providers and researchers access to diversified data sets, ultimately leading to more accurate models and improved diagnoses. The findings underscore the potential acceleration of medical research, improved treatment outcomes, and patient empowerment through data ownership. The synergy of FL and blockchain envisions a healthcare ecosystem that prioritizes individual privacy and propels advancements in medical science.

ID DESIGN
AB Federated edge learning (FL) has become an unprecedented machine learning paradigm that enables distributed training across multiple edge devices without sharing their private data. Nevertheless, recent privacy eavesdropping attacks have raised severe privacy concerns, which make FL untrustworsthy and thus hinder the wide deployment of FL in emerging high-stake applications, such as vehicular networks and healthcare industry. Fortunately, differential privacy (DP) provides a flexible approach by introducing additional randomness to the released model updates so that the eavesdroppers cannot divulge any private information. However, the injected perturbation ensures privacy at the expense of learning accuracy and communication cost, yielding an accuracy-privacy-communication dilemma. In this article, we propose an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) approach to tackle the dilemma in differentially private FL, which is achieved by exploiting the reconfigurability of active RIS to address the heterogeneous wireless links and privacy concerns, as well as the waveform superposition property with over-the-air computation (AirComp) for low-latency model aggregation. We comprehensively analyze the convergence behavior and systematic privacy guarantee of the active RIS-enabled differentially private FL system, followed by proposing a two-step online power adaptation scheme to minimize the learning optimality gap while satisfying the systematic privacy and power constraints by jointly designing the transmit scalar and artificial noise at the edge devices and the reflection beamforming pattern at the active RIS. Simulation results validate our theoretical achievements and demonstrate the advancements of active RIS in addressing the accuracy-privacy-communication dilemma in differentially private FL.

AB Federated learning (FL) provides a new paradigm for protecting data privacy in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). To reduce network burden and latency brought by FL with a parameter server at the cloud, hierarchical federated learning (HFL) with mobile edge computing (MEC) servers is proposed. However, HFL suffers from a bottleneck of communication and energy overhead before reaching satisfying model accuracy as IIoT devices dramatically increase. In this article, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based joint resource allocation and IIoT device orchestration policy using nonorthogonal multiple access is proposed to achieve a more accurate model and reduce overhead for MEC-assisted HFL in IIoT. We formulate a multiobjective optimization problem to simultaneously minimize latency, energy consumption, and model accuracy under the constraints of computing capacity and transmission power of IIoT devices. To solve it, we propose a DRL algorithm based on deep deterministic policy gradient. Simulation results show proposed algorithm outperforms others.

ID AGGREGATION
AB While Federated learning (FL) is attractive for pulling privacy-preserving distributed training data, the credibility of participating clients and non-inspectable data pose new security threats, of which poisoning attacks are particularly rampant and hard to defend without compromising privacy, performance or other desirable properties. In this paper, we propose a self-purified FL (SPFL) method that enables benign clients to exploit trusted historical features of locally purified model to supervise the training of aggregated model in each iteration. The purification is performed by an attention-guided self-knowledge distillation where the teacher and student models are optimized locally for task loss, distillation loss and attention loss simultaneously. SPFL imposes no restriction on the communication protocol and aggregator at the server. It can work in tandem with any existing secure aggregation algorithms and protocols for augmented security and privacy guarantee. We experimentally demonstrate that SPFL outperforms state-of-the-art FL defenses against poisoning attacks. The attack success rate of SPFL trained model remains the lowest among all defense methods in comparison, even if the poisoning attack is launched in every iteration with all but one malicious clients in the system. Meantime, it improves the model quality on normal inputs compared to FedAvg, either under attack or in the absence of an attack.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-aware data mining strategy keeping the private data on the owners' machine and thereby confidential. The clients compute local models and send them to an aggregator which computes a global model. In hybrid FL, the local parameters are additionally masked using secure aggregation, such that only the global aggregated statistics become available in clear text, not the client specific updates. In this context, we investigate the data leakage of three popular algorithms for QR decomposition, Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization, the Householder algorithm and Givens rotation. We show that, even when using additive SMPC, Givens rotation and the Householder matrix leak raw data and are therefore not suited for this computation paradigm. Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization relies on inner vector products and does not leak raw data points.

AB A single sensor radar can no longer satisfy the increasingly complex electromagnetic environment. More attention is paid to radar sensor networks, which can obtain more information from different nodes and points of view. Moreover, better detection and tracking performance can be achieved through resource sharing and complementary advantages (joint learning). How to improve the utilization efficiency of multiple radar sensors with limited resources is an open problem, which can be transformed into joint learning in scenarios, such as limited training data or imbalanced samples. This article presents a distributed learning model to solve these problems. It has three phases. Self-reweighting (SR) loss is developed to dynamically rebalance the gradients of positive and negative samples for each category, after which the imbalance of samples can be alleviated. An image generation technique via target reimaging addresses the problem of limited samples. SR loss and image generation are then unified in a federated learning (FL) framework. The classifier is adjusted using virtual representations to further improve learning efficiency. Comparative studies on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

AB In Federated edge learning (FEEL), energy-constrained devices at the network edge consume significant energy when training and uploading their local machine learning models, leading to a decrease in their lifetime. This work proposes novel solutions for energy-efficient FEEL by jointly considering local training data, available computation, and communications resources, and deadline constraints of FEEL rounds to reduce energy consumption. This paper considers a system model where the edge server is equipped with multiple antennas employing beamforming techniques to communicate with the local users through orthogonal channels. Specifically, we consider a problem that aims to find the optimal user's resources, including the fine-grained selection of relevant training samples, bandwidth, transmission power, beamforming weights, and processing speed with the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption given a deadline constraint on the communication rounds of FEEL. Then, we devise tractable solutions by first proposing a novel fine-grained training algorithm that excludes less relevant training samples and effectively chooses only the samples that improve the model's performance. After that, we derive closed-form solutions, followed by a Golden-Section-based iterative algorithm to find the optimal computation and communication resources that minimize energy consumption. Experiments using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithms considerably outperform the state-of-the-art solutions as energy consumption decreases by 79% for MNIST and 73% for CIFAR-10 datasets.

AB As the Augmented Intelligence of Things (AIoT) advances within vehicle-road coordination systems, challenges related to road traffic data transmission and processing are being increasingly addressed. However, this progress also brings significant risks of privacy data leakage. Federated learning (FL), a distributed machine learning paradigm, effectively safeguards client data privacy by allowing multiple participants to collaboratively train models while keeping their data localized. Despite its benefits, FL faces challenges, such as model parameter leakage and Byzantine attacks. To tackle these issues, this article introduces an anonymous and efficient FL framework for vehicle-road coordination systems (AEFL), designed to ensure a secure and reliable vehicle data transmission process. This architecture incorporates a novel group pairing onion routing protocol, which leverages pairing cryptography principles for hierarchical data encryption. During the routing process, relay group nodes decrypt the corresponding layer, ensuring both data confidentiality and node anonymity. Additionally, a sampling method is proposed to accurately identify Byzantine vehicle nodes, enhancing the precision of FL aggregation without compromising overall model performance. Experimental results show that AEFL outperforms the classic TOR anonymous routing protocol, achieving a 100% message delivery rate more quickly. Under the same conditions, the anonymity of the source node and the destination node improves by 3.9% and 1.9%, respectively. When half of the nodes are compromised, path anonymity can be increased by 24.8%. Furthermore, our framework excels in FL aggregation efficiency, with a Byzantine adversary detection accuracy of up to 99%.

AB Recommender systems recommend contents or services via collecting and analyzing numerous user data, which may raise serious privacy concerns when the recommender is untrusted. Inspired by federated learning, a user-level distributed matrix factorization framework has been proposed where the model can be learned via collecting gradient information from users (instead of the raw data). This approach focuses on protecting model-privacy and value-privacy from untrusted recommender but has limited consideration on existence-privacy. To address this issue, we enhance the aforementioned framework with Homomorphic Encryption and randomized response. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can provide more secure protection for users' privacy with less performance degradation and smaller computational burden. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB Over the years, Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become more powerful. This sets forth a unique opportunity to exploit local computing resources to distribute model learning and circumvent the need to share raw data. The underlying distributed and privacy-preserving data analytics approach is often termed federated learning (FL). A key challenge in FL is the heterogeneity across local datasets. In this article, we propose a new personalized FL model, PFL-DA, by adopting the philosophy of domain adaptation. PFL-DA tackles two sources of data heterogeneity at the same time: a covariate and concept shift across local devices. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that PFL-DA overcomes intrinsic shortcomings in state of the art FL approaches and is able to borrow strength across devices while allowing them to retain their own personalized model. As a case study, we apply PFL-DA to distributed desktop 3D printing where we obtain more accurate predictions of printing speed, which can help improve the efficiency of the printers.

DE federated learning (FL); fully homomor-phic encryption (FHE);
   intelligent inspection; multi-key RNS-CKKS; parameter compression
AB As a distributed machine learning architecture, Federated Learning (FL) can train a global model by exchanging users' model parameters without their local data. However, with the evolution of eavesdropping techniques, attackers can infer information related to users' local data with the intercepted model parameters, resulting in privacy leakage and hindering the application of FL in smart factories. To meet the privacy protection needs of the intelligent inspection task in pumped storage power stations, in this paper we propose a novel privacy-preserving FL algorithm based on multi-key Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), called MFHE-PPFL. Specifically, to reduce communication costs caused by deploying the FHE algorithm, we propose a self-adaptive threshold-based model parameter compression (SATMPC) method. It can reduce the amount of encrypted data with an adaptive thresholds-enabled user selection mechanism that only enables eligible devices to communicate with the FL server. Moreover, to protect model parameter privacy during transmission, we develop a secret sharing-based multi-key RNS-CKKS (SSMR) method that encrypts the device's uploaded parameter increments and supports decryption in device dropout scenarios. Security analyses and simulation results show that our algorithm can prevent four typical threat models and outperforms the state-of-the-art in communication costs with guaranteed accuracy.

AB For multiple integrated energy systems with similar energy using behavior, the federated learning mechanism can build a higher precision multivariate load prediction model for each integrated energy system. However, the data of different loads in these systems often have different time scales, limited by the characteristics and frequency of data acquisition equipment. Systems often set different hyperparameters with each other to ensure prediction accuracy, which makes it difficult to use federated learning for co -training. In this paper, a multi -stage Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) federated model based on interpolation method is proposed for multi -node multivariate load forecasting on multi -time scales. In the first stage, the load data of larger time scales are interpolated to unify all the load data to the same time scale. In the second stage, each node (i.e., each integrated energy system) uses its own data to carry out multivariate load training and establish its multivariate load forecasting model. In the third stage, based on the federated learning mechanism and fine-tuning strategy, the LSTM federated prediction of multiple loads is established by fusion training between nodes. Experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain higher precision multi -source load prediction results for multiple integrated energy systems.

ID CHALLENGES
AB This article deals with the problem of statistical and system heterogeneity in a cross-silo federated learning (FL) framework where there exist a limited number of Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT) devices in a smart building. We propose a novel graph signal processing (GSP)-inspired aggregation rule based on graph filtering dubbed "G-Fedfilt." The proposed aggregator enables a structured flow of information based on the graph's topology. This behavior allows capturing the interconnection of CIoT devices and training domain-specific models. The embedded graph filter is equipped with a tunable parameter which enables a continuous tradeoff between domain-agnostic and domain-specific FL. In the case of domain-agnostic, it forces G-Fedfilt to act similar to the conventional federated averaging (FedAvg) aggregation rule. The proposed G-Fedfilt also enables an intrinsic smooth clustering based on the graph connectivity without explicitly specified which further boosts the personalization of the models in the framework. In addition, the proposed scheme enjoys a communication-efficient time scheduling to alleviate the system heterogeneity. This is accomplished by adaptively adjusting the amount of training data samples and sparsity of the models' gradients to reduce communication desynchronization and latency. Simulation results show that the proposed G-Fedfilt achieves up to 3.99% better classification accuracy than the conventional FedAvg when concerning model personalization on the statistically heterogeneous local data sets, while it is capable of yielding up to 2.41% higher accuracy than FedAvg in the case of testing the generalization of the models. Furthermore, the proposed communication optimization scheme can boost the framework's efficiency by reducing the computation, communication desynchronization, and latency up to 70.21%, 99.65%, and 44.61%, respectively, at the cost of 0.36% accuracy and under the system heterogeneity.

AB In the realm of wireless communications, accurate Radio Signal Received Power (RSRP) prediction serves as the foundation for improving user experience and optimizing network efficiency and reliability. With the deep integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and the wireless communication network, Federated Learning (FL) is considered as a promising approach for enhancing RSRP prediction while protecting user data privacy in the upcoming of 6G network. However, in practice, the heterogeneity of User Equipment (UE) environments and the limitations of UE communication bandwidth and computational capabilities can lead to poor model performance and inefficient model interactions in FL. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Multi-head DNN based FL algorithm for RSRP prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can enhance both RSRP prediction performance and communication efficiency.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB In recent years, smart healthcare, artificial intelligence (AI)-aided diagnostics, and automated surgical robots are just a few of the innovations that have emerged and gained popularity with the advent of Healthcare 4.0. Such technologies are powered by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), which are preferable for disease diagnosis, identifying patterns, prescribing treatments, and forecasting diseases like stroke prediction, cancer prediction and so forth. Nevertheless, much data is needed for AI, ML, and DL-based systems to train effectively and provide the desired outcomes. Further, it raises concerns about data privacy, security, communication overhead, regulatory compliance and so forth. Federated learning (FL) is a technology that protects data security and privacy by limiting data sharing and utilizing model information of distributed systems to enhance performance. However, existing approaches are traditionally verified on pre-established datasets that fail to capture real-life applicability. Therefore, this study proposes an AI-enabled stroke prediction architecture consisting of FL based on the artificial neural network (ANN) model using data from actual stroke cases. This architecture can be implemented on healthcare-based wearable devices (WD) for real-time use as it is effective, precise, and computationally affordable. In order to continuously enhance the performance of the global model, the proposed FL-based architecture aggregates the optimizer weights of many clients using a fifth-generation (5G) communication channel. Then, the performance of the proposed FL-based architecture is studied based on multiple parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, bit error rate, and spectral noise. It outperforms the traditional approaches regarding accuracy, which is 5% to 10% higher.

AB Federated learning models are collaboratively developed upon valuable training data owned by multiple parties. During the development and deployment of federated models, they are exposed to risks including illegal copying, re-distribution, misuse and/or free-riding. To address these risks, the ownership verification of federated learning models is a prerequisite that protects federated learning model intellectual property rights (IPR) i.e., FedIPR. We propose a novel federated deep neural network (FedDNN) ownership verification scheme that allows private watermarks to be embedded and verified to claim legitimate IPR of FedDNN models. In the proposed scheme, each client independently verifies the existence of the model watermarks and claims respective ownership of the federated model without disclosing neither private training data nor private watermark information. The effectiveness of embedded watermarks is theoretically justified by the rigorous analysis of conditions under which watermarks can be privately embedded and detected by multiple clients. Moreover, extensive experimental results on computer vision and natural language processing tasks demonstrate that varying bit-length watermarks can be embedded and reliably detected without compromising original model performances. Our watermarking scheme is also resilient to various federated training settings and robust against removal attacks.

   Service; SCNN-Bi-LSTM; Stacked CNN
AB As the digital landscape expands rapidly due to technological advancements, cybersecurity concerns have become more prevalent. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), which are crucial for identifying unusual network traffic indicative of malicious activity, have become a necessity. These systems can be either hardware or software -based. However, traditional IDS models often fail to adequately protect data privacy and detect complex, unique breaches, particularly within Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Stacked Convolutional Neural Network and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (SCNN-Bi-LSTM) model for intrusion detection in WSNs. This model leverages Federated Learning (FL) to enhance intrusion detection performance and safeguard privacy. The FL -based SCNN-Bi-LSTM model is unique in its approach, allowing multiple sensor nodes to collaboratively train a central global model without revealing private data, thereby alleviating privacy concerns. The deep learning methodology of the SCNN-Bi-LSTM model effectively identifies sophisticated and previously unknown cyber threats by meticulously examining both local and temporal linkages in network patterns. The model has been specifically designed to detect and categorize different types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks using specialized WSN-DS and CIC-IDS-2017 datasets. Compared to traditional Artificial Deep Neural Network (ADNN) models, our proposed FL-SCNN-BiLSTM model demonstrated superior detection rates for complex and unknown attacks, significantly improving IDS performance. The model achieved a notable classification accuracy of approximately 99.9% precision and recall on both datasets, substantially reducing false positives and negatives. Our research underscores the potential of federated learning and deep learning in enhancing the security and privacy of WSNs. The proposed FL-SCNN-Bi-LSTM architecture not only facilitates the identification of complex cyber threats but also exemplifies how deep learning techniques can be employed to bolster intrusion detection systems while preserving user data privacy.

AB The development of Internet of Things (IoT) makes human life more intelligent, and the interconnection of all things has become a reality. However, the surge in the number of devices and centralized management brings severe challenges to IoT, such as single point of failure, poor security, privacy leakage, and low reliability. Due to the decentralization, verifiability, and privacy protection of blockchain federated learning (BFL), some BFL schemes have been proposed to solve these problems, but bring new challenges, such as device privacy leakage and heavy security computing load. In this article, we propose a new decentralized, secure and verifiable consortium BFL privacy protection scheme, named LPBFL, which realizes lightweight computing while ensuring the privacy of the local model and data set of the device. To achieve lightweight privacy protection, LPBFL adopts the Paillier encryption and the newly designed lightweight digital signature and batch verification algorithm. Additionally, considering that devices upload invalid or even toxic local models intentionally or unintentionally, we design a device reputation selection mechanism to make BFL more efficient. Finally, the theoretical analysis proves the security of LPBFL and verifies the unforgeability of the proposed digital signature. Comprehensive comparisons and extensive experiments demonstrate that our LPBFL has significant advantages in multiple aspects.

AB The importance of reliable and secure wireless communication cannot be overstated, especially in emergency situations that require the use of smart wearables. To ensure the provision of robust and secure communication services for emergency applications, we propose a decentralized and real-time approach to accessing data from wearable technology. This approach involves integrating blockchain technology and federated-learning-enabled beyond 5G/6G (B5G/6G) network architecture. We also discuss the potential benefits of using massively populated and real-time-streaming, data-intensive, federated-learning-enabled B5G/6G systems to provide emergency services with real-time access to relevant information. By integrating blockchain and responsible AI frameworks, we aim to ensure the security and trustworthiness of the communication channels. We believe that our proposed solution will address sovereignty concerns and have the potential to transform the way emergency responses are handled, resulting in faster and more efficient responses that ultimately save lives.

AB In this paper, we address the problem of privacy-preserving federated neural network training with N users. We present Hercules, an efficient and high-precision training framework that can tolerate collusion of up to N - 1 users. Hercules follows the POSEIDON framework proposed by Sav et al. (NDSS'21), but makes a qualitative leap in performance with the following contributions: (i) we design a novel parallel homomorphic computation method for matrix operations, which enables fast Single Instruction and Multiple Data (SIMD) operations over ciphertexts. For the multiplication of two h x h dimensional matrices, our method reduces the computation complexity from O(h(3)) to O(h). This greatly improves the training efficiency of the neural network since the ciphertext computation is dominated by the convolution operations; (ii) we present an efficient approximation on the sign function based on the composite polynomial approximation. It is used to approximate non-polynomial functions (i.e., ReLU and max), with the optimal asymptotic complexity. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets (BCW, ESR, CREDIT, MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) show that compared with POSEIDON, Hercules obtains up to 4% increase in model accuracy, and up to 60x reduction in the computation and communication cost.

   Secure matrix multiplication; QR decomposition
AB Federated Learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables multiple participants to collaboratively train models without compromising the privacy of any party involved. Currently, vertical federated learning based on XGBoost is widely used in the industry due to its interpretability. However, existing vertical federated XGBoost algorithms either lack sufficient security, exhibit low efficiency, or struggle to adapt to large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose EVFeX, an efficient vertical federated XGBoost algorithm based on optimized secure matrix multiplication, which eliminates the need for time-consuming homomorphic encryption and achieves a level of security equivalent to encryption. It greatly enhances efficiency and remains unaffected by data volume. The proposed algorithm is compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms on three datasets, demonstrating its superior efficiency and uncompromised accuracy. We also provide theoretical analyses of the algorithm's privacy and conduct a comparative analysis of privacy, efficiency, and accuracy with related algorithms.

AB A novel framework of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-enhanced indoor wireless networks is proposed, where an RIS mounted on the robot is invoked to enable mobility of the RIS and enhance the service quality for mobile users. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques are adopted to further increase the spectrum efficiency since RISs are capable of providing NOMA with artificial controlled channel conditions, which can be seen as a beneficial operation condition to obtain NOMA gains. To optimize the sum rate of all users, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is invoked to optimize the deployment and phase shifts of the mobile RIS as well as the power allocation policy. In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of agent training for the DDPG agents, a federated learning (FL) concept is adopted to enable multiple agents to simultaneously explore similar environments and exchange experiences. We also proved that with the same random exploring policy, the FL armed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents can theoretically obtain a reward gain comparing to the independent agents. Our simulation results indicate that the mobile RIS scheme can significantly outperform the fixed RIS paradigm, which provides about three times data rate gain compared to the fixed RIS paradigm. Moreover, the NOMA scheme is capable of achieving a gain of 42% in contrast with the OMA scheme in terms of the sum rate. Finally, the multi-cell simulation proved that the FL enhanced DDPG algorithm has a superior convergence rate and optimization performance than the independent training framework.

AB The rapid development of the smart healthcare system makes the early-stage detection of dementia disease more user-friendly and affordable. However, the main concern is the potential serious privacy leakage of the system. In this article, we take Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an example and design a convenient and privacy-preserving system named ADDetector with the assistance of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and security mechanisms. Particularly, to achieve effective AD detection, ADDetector only collects user's audio by IoT devices widely deployed in the smart home environment and utilizes novel topic-based linguistic features to improve the detection accuracy. For the privacy breach existing in data, feature, and model levels, ADDetector achieves privacy-preserving by employing a unique three-layer (i.e., user, client, cloud, etc.) architecture. Moreover, ADDetector exploits federated learning (FL) based scheme to ensure the user owns the integrity of raw data and secure the confidentiality of the classification model and implement differential privacy (DP) mechanism to enhance the privacy level of the feature. Furthermore, to secure the model aggregation process between clients and cloud in FL-based scheme, a novel asynchronous privacy-preserving aggregation framework is designed. We evaluate ADDetector on 1010 AD detection trials from 99 health and AD users. The experimental results show that ADDetector achieves high accuracy of 81.9% and low time overhead of 0.7 s when implementing all privacy-preserving mechanisms (i.e., FL, DP, and cryptography-based aggregation).

AB With the expansion of intelligent services and applications powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT) permeates many aspects of our everyday lives. In order to enable several intelligent IoT applications (i.e., indoor and outdoor), Federated Learning (FL) allows AI training at remote smart devices without the requirement for data sharing. First, with a discussion of the recent developments in FL and indoor smart device networks and their integration, we present a thorough assessment of the growing applications of FL in indoor networks. Next, we investigate and evaluate FL's potential for allowing various indoor applications and services, such as data sharing, localization, navigation, human activity recognition, and security and privacy. FL in numerous critical indoor services and applications, including smart manufacturing, smart homes, and smart healthcare, is then thoroughly discussed. Finally, we conclude this survey by outlining the challenges and potential paths for further study in this rapidly expanding field.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed as flying base stations to provide wireless communication and machine learning (ML) training services for ground user equipments (UEs). Due to privacy concerns, many UEs are not willing to send their raw data to the UAV for model training. Fortunately, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective solution to privacy-preserving ML. To balance efficiency and wireless security, this paper proposes a novel secure and efficient FL framework in UAV-enabled networks. Specifically, we design a secure UE selection scheme based on the secrecy outage probability to prevent uploaded model parameters from being wiretapped by a malicious eavesdropper. Then, we formulate a joint UAV placement and resource allocation problem for minimizing training time and UE energy consumption while maximizing the number of secure UEs under the UAV's energy constraint. Considering the random movement of the eavesdropper and UEs as well as online task generation on UEs in practical application scenarios, we present the long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm (LSTM-DDPG) to facilitate real-time decision making for the formulated problem. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed LSTM-DDPG algorithm outperforms the state-of-arts in terms of efficiency and security of FL.

ID PROFILE
AB With an estimated five million fatal cases each year, lung cancer is one of the significant causes of death worldwide. Lung diseases can be diagnosed with a Computed Tomography (CT) scan. The scarcity and trustworthiness of human eyes is the fundamental issue in diagnosing lung cancer patients. The main goal of this study is to detect malignant lung nodules in a CT scan of the lungs and categorize lung cancer according to severity. In this work, cutting-edge Deep Learning (DL) algorithms were used to detect the location of cancerous nodules. Also, the real-life issue is sharing data with hospitals around the world while bearing in mind the organizations' privacy issues. Besides, the main problems for training a global DL model are creating a collaborative model and maintaining privacy. This study presented an approach that takes a modest amount of data from multiple hospitals and uses blockchain-based Federated Learning (FL) to train a global DL model. The data were authenticated using blockchain technology, and FL trained the model internationally while maintaining the organization's anonymity. First, we presented a data normalization approach that addresses the variability of data obtained from various institutions using various CT scanners. Furthermore, using a CapsNets method, we classified lung cancer patients in local mode. Finally, we devised a way to train a global model cooperatively utilizing blockchain technology and FL while maintaining anonymity. We also gathered data from real-life lung cancer patients for testing purposes. The suggested method was trained and tested on the Cancer Imaging Archive (CIA) dataset, Kaggle Data Science Bowl (KDSB), LUNA 16, and the local dataset. Finally, we performed extensive experiments with Python and its well-known libraries, such as Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow, to evaluate the suggested method. The findings showed that the method effectively detects lung cancer patients. The technique delivered 99.69 % accuracy with the smallest possible categorization error.

ID DESIGN
AB Over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) is an emerging technique to reduce the computation and communication overload caused by the orthogonal transmissions of the model updates in conventional federated learning (FL). This reduction is achieved at the expense of introducing aggregation error that can be efficiently suppressed by means of receive beamforming via large array-antennas. This paper studies OTA-FL in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with limited number of radio frequency (RF)-chains. For this setting, the beamforming for over-the-air model aggregation needs to be addressed jointly with antenna selection. This leads to an NP-hard problem due to its combinatorial nature. We develop three different algorithms to solve the problem. First, we use the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) technique and propose a two-tier algorithm for joint antenna selection and beamforming. The second algorithm interprets the antenna selection task as a sparse recovery problem and invokes the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) algorithm to approximate the sparse solution. The third algorithm invokes the same sparse recovery based interpretation, but employs the low-complexity method of fast iterative soft-thresholding to find a sparse solution. Convergence and complexity analysis is presented for all the algorithms. The numerical investigations depict that the two algorithms based on the sparse recovery interpretation outperform the PDD-based algorithm, when the number of RF-chains at the edge server is much smaller than its array size. However, as the number of RF-chains increases, the PDD-based algorithm outperforms. Our simulations further depict that learning performance with all the antennas being active at the parameter server (PS) can be closely tracked by selecting less than 20% of the antennas at the PS.

AB The combination of machine learning (ML) and the Internet of Medical Things has emerged as one of the most critical modes for disease diagnoses and treatments. As the medical data in IoMT is sensitive, it is urgent to protect the data privacy when training a ML model. Therefore, researchers are exploring federated learning (FL), a distributed ML framework that enables participants to model together without sharing data. Nevertheless, existing works neglect to verify the reliability of the participants, the integrity, and the credibility of messages. In this situation, the attackers can inject malicious messages to reduce FL results' accuracy. In this paper, we focus on horizontal FL (HFL) with the natural paradigm of "IoT nodes (INs) -edge nodes (ENs) -center server" and propose an efficient and privacy-preserving disease research (EPDR) system. In EPDR, to verify the reliability of the participants, we apply a new digital signature scheme with message recovery. To protect the privacy of participants, we split the messages and transmit them through the ENs to hide the relationship between the messages and the INs. To ensure confidentiality, integrity, and credibility of messages, we use a linear homomorphic encryption scheme and the message authentication code. The security analysis demonstrates that our proposal can preserve privacy and resist the member inference attack, model inversion attack, and impersonation attack. The performance analysis shows that our proposal has lower computation and communication costs than current methods.

AB As an irreversible trend, connected vehicles have become increasingly more popular. They depend on the generation and sharing of data between vehicles to improve safety and efficiency of the transportation system. Due to the open feature of the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), it is possible for dishonest and misbehaving vehicles to disrupt traffic by transmitting false information. In recent years, misbehavior detection systems have been developed to detect the malicious behaviour, and machine learning methods have been employed to make the detection more accurately. However, existing misbehavior detection systems typically require a single entity (e.g., a central server) for centralized data collection and training. Model updates are restricted due to data privacy and high overhead of data communication, which reduces the defensive capability of misbehavior detection systems. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning scheme to detect misbehavior, which is trained collaboratively by coordinating multiple distributed edge devices while ensuring data security and privacy. In addition, to further protect the privacy of the model on the blockchain, differential privacy with the Gaussian mechanism is leveraged to provide strict privacy protection. Common data falsification attacks are studied in this paper. The experimental results show that our proposed scheme is feasible and effective, and demonstrate that our scheme achieves satisfied accuracy and efficiency.

ID RESOURCE-ALLOCATION
AB Edge caching is a promising solution for next-generation networks by empowering caching units in small-cell base stations (SBSs), which allows user equipments (UEs) to fetch users' requested contents that have been pre-cached in SBSs. It is crucial for SBSs to predict accurate popular contents through learning while protecting users' personal information. Traditional federated learning (FL) can protect users' privacy but the data discrepancies among UEs can lead to a degradation in model quality. Therefore, it is necessary to train personalized local models for each UE to predict popular contents accurately. In addition, the cached contents can be shared among adjacent SBSs in next-generation networks, thus caching predicted popular contents in different SBSs may affect the cost to fetch contents. Hence, it is critical to determine where the popular contents are cached cooperatively. To address these issues, we propose a cooperative edge caching scheme based on elastic federated and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CEFMR) to optimize the cost in the network. We first propose an elastic FL algorithm to train the personalized model for each UE, where adversarial autoencoder (AAE) model is adopted for training to improve the prediction accuracy, then a popular content prediction algorithm is proposed to predict the popular contents for each SBS based on the trained AAE model. Finally, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based algorithm to decide where the predicted popular contents are collaboratively cached among SBSs. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme to existing baseline caching schemes.

AB In this paper, the problem of enhancing the virtual reality (VR) experience for wireless users is investigated by minimizing the occurrence of breaks in presence (BIP) that can detach the users from their virtual world. To measure the BIP for wireless VR users, a novel model that jointly considers the VR application type, transmission delay, VR video quality, and users' awareness of the virtual environment is proposed. In the developed model, base stations (BSs) transmit VR videos to the wireless VR users using directional transmission links so as to provide high data rates for the VR users, thus, reducing the number of BIP for each user. Since the body movements of a VR user may result in a blockage of its wireless link, the location and orientation of VR users must also be considered when minimizing BIP. The BIP minimization problem is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly considers the predictions of users' locations, orientations, and their BS association. To predict the orientation and locations of VR users, a distributed learning algorithm based on the machine learning framework of deep echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed. The proposed algorithm uses federated learning to enable multiple BSs to locally train their deep ESNs using their collected data and cooperatively build a learning model to predict the entire users' locations and orientations. Using these predictions, the user association policy that minimizes BIP is derived. Simulation results demonstrate that the developed algorithm reduces the users' BIP by up to 16 and 26, respectively, compared to centralized ESN and deep learning algorithms.

AB Massive amounts of high-quality data are the prerequisite and support for AI technologies. Due to the nature of privacy-preserving and low communication overheads, federated learning (FL) has garnered considerable attention in comparison with traditional data collection methods. However, the performance of FL is hampered by the lack of interested clients and limited local data due to selfishness and individual behavioral preferences. To this end, we propose PractFL, a proactive and distributed framework that incorporates the concept of mobile crowdsensing into the FL paradigm. Specifically, we design an incentive mechanism in the form of virtual red packets, which are a widely used way of monetary reward and gift-giving in social lives. In this article we extend this further by giving meaning to the locations, i.e., the red packets are only accessible at specific places. The virtual red packets' locations and monetary amounts can be dynamically updated by the cloud center to encourage clients to collect additional data that may benefit the FL process. Further, we propose a distributed behavioral decision engine based on multiarmed bandits (i.e., choose which red packet to go for) in response to the incentive mechanism enforced by the cloud. Considering the movement cost and conflicts with otherclients, K-anonymity and probabilistic selection are introduced in the distributed behavioral decision to recommend the optimal red packet choice for clients without revealing their privacy. The experimental results demonstrate that PractFL outperforms the baselines in terms of classification accuracy. We also find that PractFL can effectively alleviate the overfitting problem caused by class imbalance during the training.

AB Accurate prediction of user dropout is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of social care applications developed for the elderly. Given the sensitive nature of healthcare data, this study introduces a Federated Learning (FL) approach to predict user dropout while preserving data privacy by keeping personal data on local devices and only sharing model updates. We propose three client selection methods-Balanced label distribution, Data-Rich client prioritization, and a Combined strategy-that enhance predictive performance, computational efficiency,reduce carbon emissions, and decrease training duration. Additionally, we evaluate sampling strategies, including oversampling, undersampling, and combined over-under sampling, to address class imbalance in real-world dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that our FL approach with the Balanced client selection method achieves an F1 score of 76.4%, surpassing the traditional centralized model by 13.5% and reducing training time and carbon emissions by 88.7%. This study underscores the potential of FL combined with strategic client selection and sampling methods to improve dropout prediction in healthcare applications while preserving privacy and promoting environmental sustainability.

AB Chatbot is an artificial intelligence application that can provide a conversational environment between humans and machines. Most organizations and industries are willing to lay out their services through chatbots because they can provide 24/7 customer support. Meanwhile, it raises security and privacy challenges like access control, data leakage during transmission, SQL injection attacks, and language model attacks, which make the users concerned about their data, performance, and accuracy. Therefore, this research paper proposes a comprehensive framework integrating blockchain, federated learning, and a fully homomorphic encryption algorithm with face recognition to solve the above-mentioned chatbot's challenges. The experimental result shows that a distributed system improves chatbot accuracy (90%) and that more transactions in less time with more clients do not affect the performance. In contrast, more iterations and clients will decrease the accuracy, performance, and transactions in a centralized system. In addition, fully homomorphic encryption improves and speeds up the data encryption process. It encrypted more data (1792 MB) in a small amount of 1240 times per second, and conversations and transactions can be transferred via a secure network to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of users' data. The implementation of such a comprehensive framework in real-life situations can improve chatbot security when it actively works as a customer agent in an organization.

AB Privacy-preserving aggregation protocol is an essential building block in privacy-enhanced federated learning (FL), which enables the server to obtain the sum of users' locally trained models while keeping local training data private. However, most of the work on privacy-preserving aggregation provides privacy guarantees for only one communication round in FL. In fact, as FL usually involves long-term training, i.e., multiple rounds, it may lead to more information leakages due to the dynamic user participation over rounds. In this connection, we propose a long-term privacy-preserving aggregation (LTPA) protocol providing both single-round and multi-round privacy guarantees. Specifically, we first introduce our batch-partitioning-dropping-updating (BPDU) strategy that enables any user-dynamic FL system to provide multi-round privacy guarantees. Then we present our LTPA construction which integrates our proposed BPDU strategy with the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving aggregation protocol. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of LTPA parameter settings on the trade-off between privacy guarantee, protocol efficiency, and FL convergence performance from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Experimental results show that LTPA provides similar complexity to that of the state-of-the-art, i.e., an additional cost of around only 1.04X for a 100,000-user FL system, with an additional long-term privacy guarantee.

DT Article
AB Machine learning relies on the availability of vast amounts of data for training. However, in reality, data are mostly scattered across different organizations and cannot be easily integrated due to many legal and practical constraints. To address this important challenge in the field of machine learning, we introduce a new technique and framework, known as federated transfer learning (FTL), to improve statistical modeling under a data federation. FTL allows knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy and enables complementary knowledge to be transferred across domains in a data federation, thereby enabling a target-domain party to build flexible and effective models by leveraging rich labels from a source domain. This framework requires minimal modifications to the existing model structure and provides the same level of accuracy as the nonprivacy-preserving transfer learning. It is flexible and can be effectively adapted to various secure multiparty machine learning tasks.

AB Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a crucial approach in the realm of distributed machine learning, providing a framework for training models on decentralized data while preserving data privacy. This paradigm has established itself as an effective solution for deploying artificial intelligence technology in scenarios associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Despite its potential, FL faces encounters several challenges, particularly the limited computational and communication capabilities of some local clients, which can hinder further advancement. Such constraints limit the effective implementation and utilization of deep neural networks (DNNs) with numerous parameters on IoT devices. Our study tackles this issue by utilizing Group Lasso for model sparsification and pruning, aimed at lowering the computational and communication demands on IoT devices. Moreover, this article proposes a Group Lasso-enabled FL model pruning strategy specifically tailored for IoT, designed to reduce the size of model parameters, and provides theoretical guarantees of FL convergence. Empirical analysis across multiple models and data sets demonstrates that our method effectively halved the parameters in fully connected layers during federated training. This substantial reduction is achieved with minimal impact on accuracy, thus preserving the integrity of model performance and providing a competitive edge over existing methodologies.

AB With the exponential growth of the Internet of things (IoT) in remote sensing image applications, network resource orchestration and data privacy are significant aspects to handle in bigdata cellular networks. The image data sharing procedure toward central cloud servers in order to perform real-time classifications has leaked client personalization and heavily burdened the communication networks. Thus, the deployment of IoT image sensors in privacy-constrained sectors requires an optimized federated learning (FL) scheme to efficiently consider both aspects of securing data privacy and maximizing the model accuracy with sufficient communication and computation resources. In this article, an adaptive model communication scheme with virtual resource optimization for edge FL is proposed by converging a deep q-learning algorithm to enforce a self-learning agent interacting with network functions virtualization orchestrator and software-defined networking based architecture. The agent targets to optimize the resource control policy of virtual multi-access edge computing entities in virtualized infrastructure manager. The proposed scheme trains the learning model and weighs the optimal actions for particular network states by using an epsilon-greedy strategy. In the exploitation phase, the scheme considers multiple spatial-resolution sensing conditions and allocates computation offloading resources for global multiconvolutional neural networks model aggregation based on the congestion states. In the simulation results, the quality of service and global collaborative model performance metrics were evaluated in terms of delay, packet drop ratios, packet delivery ratios, loss values, and overall accuracy.

AB The coronavirus pandemic has overburdened medical institutions, forcing physicians to diagnose and treat their patients remotely. Moreover, COVID-19 has made humans more conscious about their health, resulting in the extensive purchase of IoT-enabled medical devices. The rapid boom in the market worth of the internet of medical things (IoMT) captured cyber attackers' attention. Like health, medical data is also sensitive and worth a lot on the dark web. Despite the fact that the patient's health details have not been protected appropriately, letting the trespassers exploit them. The system administrator is unable to fortify security measures due to the limited storage capacity and computation power of the resource-constrained network devices'. Although various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms have been developed to identify anomalies, the primary undertaking is to explore the swift progressing malicious attacks before they deteriorate the wellness system's integrity. In this paper, a Dew-Cloud based model is designed to enable hierarchical federated learning (HFL). The proposed Dew-Cloud model provides a higher level of data privacy with greater availability of IoMT critical application(s). The hierarchical long-term memory (HLSTM) model is deployed at distributed Dew servers with a backend supported by cloud computing. Data pre-processing feature helps the proposed model achieve high training accuracy (99.31%) with minimum training loss (0.034). The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed HFL-HLSTM model is superior to existing schemes in terms of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f-score.

AB Nowadays, wireless sensor network technology is being increasingly popular which is applied to a wide range of Internet of Things. Especially, Power Internet of Things is an important and rapidly growing section in Internet of Thing systems, which benefited from the application of wireless sensor networks to achieve fine-grained information collection. Meanwhile, the privacy risk is gradually exposed, which is the widespread concern for electricity power consumers. Non-intrusive load monitoring, in particular, is a technique to recover state of appliances from only the energy consumption data, which enables adversary inferring the behavior privacy of residents. There can be no doubt that applying local differential privacy to achieve privacy preserving in the local setting is more trustworthy than centralized approach for electricity customers. Although it is hard to control the risk and achieve the trade-off between privacy and utility by traditional local differential privacy obfuscation mechanisms, some existing obfuscation mechanisms based on artificial intelligence, called advanced obfuscation mechanisms, can achieve it. However, the large computing resource consumption to train the machine learning model is not affordable for most Power Internet of Thing terminal. In this article, to solve this problem, IFed was proposed-a novel federated learning framework that let electric provider who normally is adequate in computing resources to help Power Internet of Thing users. First, the optimized framework was proposed in which the trade-off between local differential privacy, data utility, and resource consumption was incorporated. Concurrently, the following problem of privacy preserving on the machine learning model transport between electricity provider and customers was noted and resolved. Last, users were categorized based on different levels of privacy requirements, and stronger privacy guarantee was provided for sensitive users. The formal local differential privacy analysis and the experiments demonstrated that IFed can fulfill the privacy requirements for Power Internet of Thing users.

AB With the rapid integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and artificial intelligence (AI) function, the data management and privacy issue has drawn great attentions in intelligent IoT systems where communication infrastructures frequently exchange open data flows over the air. Therefore, lightweight and private access over radio communication pipes becomes a critical but challengeable need for resource-constrained IoT devices due to the limited memory capacity, computing, and energy consumption. In this article, we develop the concept of deep federated scattering fingerprinting aided by differential privacy (DFSF-DP) in which a deep fingerprinting data learning network exploits fingerprinting data to realize lightweight intelligent access and incorporates federated learning with differential privacy to guarantee the data privacy in a way of distributed training. Particularly, first, we employ a wavelet scattering network for the efficient radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) feature extraction and construct a high information density database. Subsequently, the implementation of distributed learning minimizes the demand for computing resources, by exploiting the full potential of edge and cloud nodes to aggregate the global model. To bolster the data privacy and security, adaptive clipping and gradient noising are incorporated into DFSF-DP. Experimental results demonstrate that DFSF-DP obtains outstanding performance and achieves equivalent advancements while utilizing a mere 25% of the original data set. Moreover, it attains a 93% identification accuracy with 0.1 noise multiplier which confirms the remarkable performance of DFSF-DP while upholding privacy and security considerations.

AB The innovations heralded through the implementation of next-generation 5G (Fifth-Generation) networks provide an opportunity for the efficient coexistence of heterogeneous services distributed by a single physical virtualized infrastructure. Indeed, thanks to the possibility of virtualization of network functions implemented in 5G networks, the management of physical resources will be able to become more flexible and users will be able to benefit from a service customization to satisfy their demand in terms of energy efficiency, throughput and communication reliability. However, these advances are not without constraints. The management of physical and virtual resources will become more complex given the number of connected objects which will increase, generating a large volume of data to manage. This therefore requires the implementation of much more intelligent systems in the network controllers in order to guarantee the QoS (Quality of Service) of the communications. Thus, an important axis of research is now oriented towards artificial intelligence techniques, more precisely reinforcement learning to overcome this problem. Driven by this context, we are directing our research towards improving the QoS offered to users of connected objects by proposing an optimization model based on network slicing and federated reinforcement learning in order to minimize energy consumption, maximize user throughputs and reduce latency during communications between LoRa (Long Range) devices. The results obtained by the simulations carried out in a realistic framework clearly demonstrate that our proposal optimizes the traffic in each network slice and also for the individual user.

AB Industry 4.0 has become a reality by fusing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), providing huge opportunities in the way manufacturing companies operate. However, the adoption of this paradigm shift, particularly in the field of smart factories and production, is still in its infancy, suffering from various issues, such as the lack of high-quality data, data with high-class imbalance, or poor diversity leading to inaccurate AI models. However, data is severely fragmented across different silos owned by several parties for a range of reasons, such as compliance and legal concerns, preventing discovery and insight-driven IIoT innovation. Notably, valuable and even vital information often remains unutilized as the rise and adoption of AI and IoT in parallel with the concerns and challenges associated with privacy and security. This adversely influences interand intra-organization collaborative use of IIoT data. To tackle these challenges, this article leverages emerging multi-party technologies, privacy-enhancing techniques (e.g., Federated Learning), and AI approaches to present a holistic, decentralized architecture to form a foundation and cradle for a cross-company collaboration platform and a federated data space to tackle the creeping fragmented data landscape. Moreover, to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed reference model, a collaborative predictive diagnostics and maintenance case study is mapped to an edge-enabled IIoT architecture. Experimental results show the potential advantages of using the proposed approach for multi-party applications accelerating sovereign data sharing through Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles.

AB Federated learning (FL) in Internet of Things (IoT) applications facilitates the collaborative training of a global model across distributed devices with a server. Despite its potential, the distributed nature and vulnerability of IoT devices render FL susceptible to Byzantine attacks. Existing approaches to counter these attacks are often impractical in real-world IoT scenarios, mainly due to the challenges posed by nonindependent identically distributed (non-IID) data and the high-dimensional model common in IoT devices. To address these challenges, we propose Guard-FL, an efficient and robust aggregation mechanism assisted by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) for FL. Guard-FL is designed to enhance the performance of the global model in non-IID data environments without compromising defense capabilities. Specifically, it utilizes UMAP to capture nonlinear features among high-dimensional local models. Based on these features, robust regression and unsupervised clustering techniques are applied to effectively detect and remove attackers from local model updates. Subsequently, the server employs information stored in weights (IIWs) to evaluate and aggregate the remaining divergent model updates, thus significantly improving the global model's performance. To validate the efficacy of Guard-FL, we provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence properties. Our experiments demonstrate that Guard-FL surpasses existing state-of-the-art solutions, achieving up to 96% accuracy in detecting malicious clients on non-IID CIFAR-10 data sets under various Byzantine attack scenarios. The implementation code is provided at https://github.com/XidianNSS/Guard-FL.git.

TI A blockchain-empowered secure federated domain generalization framework

AB The digitization transformation of traditional machinery and advances in artificial intelligence have led to the development of data-driven machinery fault diagnosis methods. However, limited by the number of machinery equipment, it is challenging for small or medium sized manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) to collect sufficient data to support the effective execution of these methods. In addition, due to the potential conflicts of interest and risks of privacy leakage, direct sharing of raw data between enterprises is often impractical. To this end, a blockchain-empowered secure federated domain generalization (FDG) framework is proposed in this paper, aiming to achieve distributed collaborative machinery fault diagnosis. In this framework, blockchain technology is first employed to replace the central server in federated learning (FL) system, effectively mitigating the single-point-of-failure issue of the FL system. Second, a committee-based consensus mechanism is designed to verify the correctness of the global model. To achieve domain generalization (DG) in federated setting, two regularizers are incorporated into the proposed framework, which restrict the information contained in representation and perform implicit distribution alignment. Experimental studies on two datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art FDG methods in terms of diagnosis accuracy. The high reliability of the proposed framework makes it more suitable for practical industrial scenarios.

ID SCHEME
AB The deep integration of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and Artificial intelligence makes the further development of intelligent medical services possible, but privacy leakage and data security problems hinder its wide application. Although the combination of IoMT and federated learning (FL) can achieve no direct access to the original data of participants, FL still can't resist inference attacks against model parameters and the single point of failure of the central server. In addition, malicious clients can disguise as benign participants to launch poisoning attacks, which seriously compromises the accuracy of the global model. In this paper, we design a new privacy protection framework (BFG) for decentralized FL using blockchain, differential privacy and Generative Adversarial Network. The framework can effectively avoid a single point of failure and resist inference attacks. In particular, it can limit the success rate of poisoning attacks to less than 26%. Moreover, the framework alleviates the storage pressure of the blockchain, achieves a balance between privacy budget and global model accuracy, and can effectively resist the negative impact of node withdrawal. Simulation experiments on image datasets show that the BFG framework has a better combined performance in terms of accuracy, robustness and privacy preservation.

   encryption; Social network
AB With the growing number of Location-Based Social Networks, privacy-preserving point-of -interest (POI) recommendation has become a critical challenge when helping users dis-cover potentially interesting new places. Traditional systems take a centralized approach that requires the transmission and collection of private user data. In this work, we present FedPOIRec, a privacy-preserving federated learning approach enhanced with features from user social circles to generate top -N POI recommendations. First, the FedPOIRec framework is built on the principle that local data never leave the owner's device, while a parameter server blindly aggregates the local updates. Second, the local recommender results are per-sonalized by allowing users to exchange their learned parameters, enabling knowledge transfer among friends. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving protocol for integrat-ing the preferences of the user's friends, after the federated computation, by exploiting the properties of the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) fully homomorphic encryption scheme. To evaluate FedPOIRec, we apply our approach to five real-world datasets using two recom-mendation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedPOIRec achieves compara-ble recommendation quality to centralized approaches, while the social integration protocol incurs low computation and communication overhead on the user device.

DE Federated learning; Model aggregation algorithms; Data heterogeneity;
   Model replacement attacks; Mitigating attacks mechanism
AB Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing data, but traditional static averaging of local updates leads to poor performance on heterogeneous data. The following remedies, either by scheduling data distribution or mitigating local discrepancies, predominately fail to handle fine-grained heterogeneity (e.g., local imbalanced labels). To commence, we reveal that static averaging leads to the global model suffering from the mean fallacy. . That is, the averaging process favors the local model with large parameters numerically rather than knowledge. To tackle this, we introduce FedVSA, a simple-yet-effective model aggregation framework sensitive to heterogeneous local data merits. Specifically, we invent a new global loss function for FL by prioritizing the valuable local updates, facilitating efficient convergence. We deduce a softmaxbased aggregation rule and prove its convergence property via rigorous theoretical analysis. Additionally, we expose poisoning threats of model replacement that utilize the mean fallacy for attacks. To mitigate this threat, we propose a two-step mechanism involving auditing historic local training statistics and analyzing the Shapley Value. . Through extensive experiments, we show that FedVSA achieves faster convergence (--1.52x) and higher accuracy (--1.6%) compared to the baselines. It also effectively mitigates poisoning attacks by agilely recovering and returning to normal aggregation.

AB An advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) system plays a key role in the smart grid (SG), but it is vulnerable to cyberattacks. Current detection methods for AMI cyberattacks mainly focus on the data center or a distributed independent node. On one hand, it is difficult to train an excellent detection intrusion model on a self-learning independent node. On the other hand, large amounts of data are shared over the network and uploaded to a central node for training. These processes may compromise data privacy, cause communication delay, and incur high communication costs. With these limitations, we propose an intrusion detection method for AMI system based on federated learning (FL). The intrusion detection system is deployed in the data concentrators for training, and only its model parameters are communicated to the data center. Furthermore, the data center distributes the learning to each data concentrator through aggregation and weight assignments for collaborative learning. An optimized deep neural network (DNN) is exploited for this proposed method, and extensive experiments based on the NSL-KDD dataset are carried out. From the results, this proposed method improves detection performance and reduces computation costs, communication delays, and communication overheads while guaranteeing data privacy.

AB The rapid integration of IoT, cloud, and edge computing has resulted in highly interconnected networks, emphasizing the need for advanced Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to maintain security. Successful AI-based IDS relies on high-quality data for model training. Even though a vast array of datasets from controlled settings are accessible, many fall short as they are outdated and lack the representative data of network traffic dynamics typically seen in public networks. This paper aims to advance understanding in designing testbed architectures for defense mechanisms within public networks. At its core, this research introduces a unique testbed utilizing the connectivity of panOULU Municipal public network in the city of Oulu, Finland. This experimental setup examines AI-driven security across the public network. It utilizes edge-to-cloud infrastructures, incorporating Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) via the VMware vSphere platform. During the training phase, a script distinguishes incoming packets as either benign or malicious based on well-defined local parameters and simulated attack scenarios. This labeled data is then utilized for training machine learning models within the Federated Learning framework, FED-ML. Subsequently, these models are evaluated on previously unseen data. The entire procedure, from traffic gathering to model training, operates without human involvement. The evaluation dataset and testbed configuration we have made publicly available through this research can deepen our understanding of the challenges in safeguarding public networks, especially those that blend various technologies in diverse environments.

AB Smart grids face more cyber threats than before with the integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems. Data-driven-based machine learning (ML) methods have been verified to be effective in detecting attacks in power electronics devices. However, standard ML solution requires centralized data collection and processing, which is becoming infeasible in more and more applications due to efficiency issues and increasing data privacy concerns. In this letter, we propose a novel decentralized ML framework for detecting false data injection (FDI) attacks on solar PV dc/dc and dc/ac converters. The proposed paradigm incorporates the emerging technology named federated learning (FL) that enables collaboratively training across devices without sharing raw data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first application of FL for power electronics in the literature. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach can provide efficient FDI attack detection for PV systems and is aligned with the trend of critical data privacy regulations.

AB Federated learning is gaining significant interests as it enables model training over a large volume of data that is distributedly stored over many users. However, Malicious or dishonest aggregator still possible to infer sensitive information and even restore private data from local model updates even destroy the process of training. To solve the problem, researchers have proposed many excellent methods based on privacy protection technologies, such as secure multiparty computation (MPC), homomorphic encryption (HE), and differential privacy. But these methods don't only ignore users' address and identity privacy, but also include nothing about a feasible scheme to trace malicious users and malicious gradients. In this paper, we propose a general decentralized byzantine-fault-tolerant federated learning protocol, named TFPA, which can integrate multiple learning algorithms. This protocol can not only ensure the accuracy of aggregation under the adversary setting of 4 f + 1, but also provide user address privacy and identity privacy assurance. In addition, we also provide a heuristic malicious gradient discovery and tracking scheme to help participants better resist malicious gradients and ensure the fairness of aggregation to a certain extent. We evaluate our framework on Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, MLP and RNN, and attain good results both in accuracy and performance. Last but not least, we also simply prove the correction and security of TFPA.

AB Federated learning (FL) has recently received significant attention in Internet of Things, due to its capability of enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train machine learning models using neural networks, without sharing their privacy-sensitive data. However, due to the heterogeneity of clients in their computation and communication capability, they might not return the training model to the server at the same time, which may result in high waiting latency at the server, especially in synchronous FL. Although asynchronous FL can reduce the waiting latency, aggregating global model in a completely asynchronous way may lead to some local models out of date, resulting in low training accuracy. To address the above issues, this paper aims to propose a novel Heterogeneous Semi-Asynchronous FL mechanism, named HSA_FL. Firstly, we use a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) approach to identify the heterogenous communication and computation capabilities of clients, based on which, we assign different training intensities to clients. Generally, the clients with lower capabilities will be assigned with less number of local updates. In addition, instead of waiting all the clients to return their training models or immediately aggregation after getting a single local model, this paper proposes two aggregation rules, named adaptive update and fixed adaptive, respectively. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the training time and improve the training accuracy as compared with some benchmark algorithms.

AB The disaggregated and hierarchical architecture of Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) with openness paradigm promises to deliver the ever demanding 5G services. Meanwhile, it also faces new challenges for the efficient deployment of Machine Learning (ML) models. Although ORAN has been designed with built-in Radio Intelligent Controllers (RIC) providing the capability of training ML models, traditional centralized learning methods may be no longer appropriate for the RICs due to privacy issues, computational burden, and communication overhead. Recently, Federated Learning (FL), a powerful distributed ML training, has emerged as a new solution for training models in ORAN systems. 5G use cases such as meeting the network slice Service Level Agreement (SLA) and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) monitoring for the smart radio resource management can greatly benefit from the FL models. However, training FL models efficiently in ORAN system is a challenging issue due to the stringent deadline of ORAN control loops, expensive compute resources, and limited communication bandwidth. Moreover, to deliver Grade of Service (GoS), the trained ML models must converge with acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we propose a second order gradient descent based FL training method named MCORANFed that utilizes compression techniques to minimize the communication cost and yet converges at a faster rate than state-of-the-art FL variants. We formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the overall resource cost and learning time, and then solve it by the decomposition method. Our experimental results prove that MCORANFed is communication efficient with respect to ORAN system, and outperforms FL methods like MFL, FedAvg, and ORANFed in terms of costs and convergence rate.

AB In recent years, Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is in a booming stage. But at the same time, the methods of attack against IoV such as Denial of Service (DoS) and deception are great threats to personal and social security. Traditional IoV intrusion detection usually adopts a centralized detection model, which has the disadvantages of untimely detection results and is difficult to protect vehicle privacy in practical applications. Meanwhile, centralized computation requires a large amount of vehicle data transmission, which overloads the wireless bandwidth. Combined the distributed computing resources of Federated Learning (FL) and the decentralized features of blockchain, an IoV intrusion detection framework named IoV-BCFL is proposed, which is capable of distributed intrusion detection and reliable logging with privacy protection. FL is used for distributing training on vehicle nodes and aggregating the training models at Road Side Unit (RSU) to reduce data transmission, protect the privacy of training data, and ensure the security of the model. A blockchain-based intrusion logging mechanism is presented, which enhances vehicle privacy protection through Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm encryption and uses Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) to store the intrusion logs. The intrusion behavior can be faithfully recorded by logging smart contract after detecting the intrusion, which can be used to track intruders, analyze security vulnerabilities, and collect evidence. Experiments based on different open source datasets show that FL achieves a high detection rates on intrusion data and effectively reduce the communication overhead, the smart contract performs well on evaluation indicators such as sending rate, latency, and throughput.

AB The individual and integration use of the Internet of Things (IoT), Information-Centric Networking (ICN), and Federated Learning (FL) have recently been used in several network-related scenarios and have consequently experienced a growing interest in the research community. Federated learning addresses the privacy and security issues of the IoT data in a decentralized manner. Also, it can be capable of training the multiple learning algorithms through local content except for exchanging data through intelligent Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms. Moreover, in ICN, the content is retrieved and stored based on the content name rather than the content location address. On the other hand, it is challenging to support the massive IoT devices by the fifth generation (5G) mobile-cellular networks. Therefore, the cellular 6G networks are expected to increase the connection capabilities by 10-100 times over 5G, which necessitates a convergence of Communication, Computing, and Caching (3C). At the same time, the in-network caching capabilities of ICN can be attractive features for IoT networks. IoT aspires to link anybody and/or everything at any time and location. However, integrating IoT with different areas is a new academic topic and is still in its infancy. As a result, this research highlights the potential of ICN for IoTs by conducting an exhaustive literature review. This work provides a comprehensive survey regarding these three recent research trends (i.e., FL, IoT, and ICN) and reviews the related state-of-the-art literature. We first describe the main features of each technology and discuss their most common and used variants. Furthermore, we envision the integration of such technologies to take advantage efficiently. Indeed, we consider their group-wise (FL-ICN-IoT) utilization based on the need for more robust security and privacy. Additionally, we cover the application fields of these technologies both individually and combinedly. Finally, we discuss the open issues of the reviewed research and describe potential directions for future avenues regarding integrating IoT, ICN, and FL technologies.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB As the frequency of natural disasters increases, the study of emergency communication becomes increasingly important. The use of federated learning (FL) in this scenario can facilitate communication collaboration between devices while protecting privacy, greatly improving system performance. Considering the complex geographic environment, the flexible mobility and large communication radius of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) make them ideal auxiliary devices for wireless communication. Using the UAV as a mobile base station can better provide stable communication signals. However, the number of ground-based IoT terminals is large and closely distributed, so if all of them transmit data to the UAV, the UAV will not be able to take on all of the computation and communication tasks because of its limited energy. In addition, there is competition for spectrum resources among many terrestrial devices, and all devices transmitting data will bring about an extreme shortage of resources, which will lead to the degradation of model performance. This will bring indelible damage to the rescue of the disaster area and greatly threaten the life safety of the vulnerable and injured. Therefore, we use user scheduling to select some terrestrial devices to participate in the FL process. In order to avoid the resource waste generated by the terrestrial device resource prediction, we use the multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm for equipment evaluation. Considering the fairness issue of selection, we try to replace the single criterion with multiple criteria, using model freshness and energy consumption weighting as reward functions. The state of the art of our approach is demonstrated by simulations on the datasets.

TI Wireless Traffic Prediction Based on a Gradient Similarity Federated

AB Wireless traffic prediction is critical to the intelligent operation of cellular networks, such as load balancing, congestion control, value-added service promotion, etc. However, the BTS data in each region has certain differences and privacy, and centralized prediction needs to transmit a large amount of traffic data, which will not only cause bandwidth consumption, but may also cause privacy leakage. Federated learning is a kind of distributed learning method with multi-client joint training and no sharing between clients. Based on existing related research, this paper proposes a gradient similarity-based federated aggregation algorithm for wireless traffic prediction (Gradient Similarity-based Federated Aggregation for Wireless Traffic Prediction) (FedGSA). First of all, this method uses a global sharing enhanced data strategy to overcome the data heterogeneity challenge of multi-client collaborative training in federated learning. Secondly, the sliding window scheme is used to construct the dual channel training data to improve the feature learning ability of the model; In addition, to improve the generalization ability of the final global model, a two-layer aggregation scheme based on gradient similarity is proposed. The personalized model is generated by comparing the gradient similarity of each client model, and the central server aggregates the personalized model to finally generate the global model. Finally, the FedGSA algorithm is applied to wireless network traffic prediction. Experiments are conducted on two real traffic datasets. Compared with the mainstream Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm, FedGSA performs better on both datasets and obtains better prediction results on the premise of ensuring the privacy of client traffic data.

AB The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) stimulates the innovation for the health-related devices such as remote patient monitoring, connected inhalers and ingestible sensors. Simultaneously, with the aid of numerous equipments, a great number of collected data can be used for disease prediction or diagnosis model establishment. However, the potential patient data leak will also bring privacy and security issues in the interaction period. To deal with these existing issues, we propose a decentralized, efficient, and privacy-enhanced federated edge learning system called DEEP-FEL, which enables medical devices in different institutions to collaboratively train a global model without raw data mutual exchange. Firstly, we design a hierarchical ring topology to alleviate centralization of the conventional training framework, and formulate the ring construction as an optimization problem, which can be solved by an efficient heuristic algorithm. Subsequently, we design an efficient parameter aggregation algorithm for distributed medical institutions to generate a nevi global model, and the total amount of data transmitted by N nodes is only 2/N times that of traditional algorithm. In addition, data security among different medical institutions is enhanced by adding artificial noise to the edge model. Finally, experimental results on three medical datasets demonstrate the superiority of our system.

AB Federated learning (FL) in Industrial IoT (IIoT) facilitates collaborative model training across distributed edge devices, ensuring data privacy and localized insights without centralized data aggregation. However, the networked parameter sharing mechanism in FL renders it vulnerable to exploitation by man-in-the-middle (MITM) attackers, potentially disrupting the model training process. To mitigate this threat, this article presents a novel blockchain-reinforced FL architecture aimed at enabling cooperative intrusion detection. Initially, FL is leveraged to aggregate all learned information from edge servers, thereby disseminating extracted attack characteristics to all participants through gradient sharing. Subsequently, a blockchain-based parameter verification scheme is introduced to safeguard against tampered local parameters affecting the global model. Clients record model parameters in smart contracts deployed on a private chain, and parameter servers verify parameter confidentiality before aggregation, ensuring only valid parameters are considered. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted using an edge IIoT cybersecurity data set comprising 61 features spanning ten protocol layers and five attacks targeting IIoT connectivity protocols. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly enhances intrusion detection accuracy, achieving a threefold improvement when two-thirds of federated nodes are subjected to MITM attacks.

AB We present a novel approach to detect fake news in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. By investigating federated learning and trusted authority methods, we address the issue of data security during training. Simultaneously, by investigating convolution transformers and user clustering, we deal with multi-modality issues in fake news data. First, we use dense embedding and the k-means algorithm to cluster users into groups that are similar to one another. We then develop a local model for each user using their local data. The server then receives the local models of users along with clustering information, and a trusted authority verifies their integrity there. We use two different types of aggregation in place of conventional federated learning systems. The initial step is to combine all users' models to create a single global model. The second step entails compiling each user's model into a local model of comparable users. Both models are supplied to users, who then select the most suitable model for identifying fake news. By conducting extensive experiments using Twitter data, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms various baselines, where it achieves an average accuracy of 0.85 in comparison to others that do not exceed 0.81.

AB As 5G and AI continue to develop, there has been a significant surge in the healthcare industry. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed immense challenges to the global health system. This study proposes an FL -supported edge computing model based on federated learning (FL) for predicting clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization. The model aims to address the challenges posed by the pandemic, such as the need for sophisticated predictive models, privacy concerns, and the non-IID nature of COVID-19 data. The model utilizes the FATE framework, known for its privacy -preserving technologies, to enhance predictive precision while ensuring data privacy and effectively managing data heterogeneity. The model's ability to generalize across diverse datasets and its adaptability in real -world clinical settings are highlighted by the use of SHAP values, which streamline the training process by identifying influential features, thus reducing computational overhead without compromising predictive precision. The study demonstrates that the proposed model achieves comparable precision to specific machine learning models when dataset sizes are identical and surpasses traditional models when larger training data volumes are employed. The model's performance is further improved when trained on datasets from diverse nodes, leading to superior generalization and overall performance, especially in scenarios with insufficient node features. The integration of FL with edge computing contributes significantly to the reliable prediction of COVID-19 patient outcomes with greater privacy. The research contributes to healthcare technology by providing a practical solution for early intervention and personalized treatment plans, leading to improved patient outcomes and efficient resource allocation during public health crises.

AB With the advancement of assisted and autonomous driving technologies, vehicles are being outfitted with an ever-increasing number of sensors. Among these, visible light sensors, or dash-cameras, produce visual data rich in information. Analyzing this visual data through crowdsensing allows for low-cost and timely perception of urban road conditions, such as identifying dangerous driving behaviors and locating parking spaces. However, uploading such massive visual data to the cloud for centralized processing can lead to significant bandwidth challenges and also raise privacy concerns among vehicle owners. Federated learning (FL), in which vehicles serve as both data generators and computing nodes, presents a promising solution to address these challenges. Nevertheless, urban roads are complex and vehicles in different locations encounter completely different scenes, resulting in non-independently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. Additionally, the diversity in dash-camera and onboard computation resources may lead to differences in the performance of locally trained models. Indiscriminate aggregating of local models from all vehicles can potentially degrade the global model's performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce FedVisual, a model aggregation approach for FL in vehicular visual crowdsensing. FedVisual leverages deep Q-network (DQN) to select appropriate local models, considering the heterogeneities in visual data contents and vehicles' specifications. By leveraging the historical training experience, an effective model selection strategy can be obtained without complex mathematical modeling. Through the extensive simulations of our self-collected driving videos, FedVisual reduces model aggregation latency by up to 3.8% while improving the model's performance by up to 3.2% compared to reference works.

AB Artificial intelligence generated image content generates desired image content according to given instructions. It is widely applied in digital marketing, video game design, and movie production. How to efficiently detect the quality of the generated images is one of the key problems. A broad learning system is a feasible solution, because it requires no complex parameter calculation and depth expansion. However, the broad learning system is built by centralized learning, so it may not take advantage of isolated feature data, which prevents broad learning systems from detecting isolated AL-generated image content. To address the above problem, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving vertical federated broad learning system for artificial intelligence generated image content (PVF-BLS). In PVF-BLS, the vertical federated architecture is introduced into the broad learning system to utilize isolated feature data and interactive data are masked by matrix masks for security. To further improve the security of PVF-BLS, this paper proposes a secure incremental learning algorithm based on matrix masks (ILA-MM) to update PVF-BLS. In ILA-MM, the interaction data are processed by matrix masks, which makes PVF-BLS more secure. Experimental results show that PVF-BLS outperforms the traditional broad learning systems when the data are isolated.

AB Federated Learning (FL) is a paradigm of distributed machine learning that enables multiple devices or clients to work together in training a common model while keeping the privacy of individual data. However, FL has several issues such as slow convergence, communication overhead, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks, particularly in Industry 5 environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and its integration with traditional manufacturing processes. These challenges stem from the diverse and non-IID nature of data distributed across clients, which leads to slow convergence and increased communication rounds. This paper aims to address these challenges by proposing a grey wolf optimisation-based federated learning (GWOFL) approach for offering resilience in Industry 5.0 settings against adversarial attacks. The proposed approach decreases the number of communication rounds, reduces the payload between clients and the server, and withstands adversarial attacks simultaneously. It also reduces communication overhead and successfully defends against data poisoning attacks. Experimental results have revealed the efficiency of the proposed approach in overcoming the challenges of FL using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The proposed approach converges faster, along with higher accuracy compared with the peer FL methods.

ID HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; FRAMEWORK
AB The Visual data collected from a single or the multi-view security camera has exponentially increased. Achieving efficient video summarization has become a vital challenge for constructing video analytics architecture. The effective techniques like video summarising are needed to minimize redundancy and guarantee that only the important facts are presented out of this enormous volume of data. Moreover, these videos contain private information, and security against different intruders has also added fuel to the existing challenges. In the recent years, numerous architectures evolved to achieve a better and more secure Multi-View Summarization (MVS) techniques that aid in better video analytics. Unfortunately, these existing architectures need an illuminated research to eradicate the aforementioned challenges. In this article, Federated Deep Gated Attention Architecture (FDGAA) is proposed for securing MVS by organizing the computing and networking resources of cloud and edge cameras collectively. The proposed architecture is a three-tier framework precisely described as 1) Video Collection Unit (VCU) that collects the videos from the different views of the camera installed. 2) Distributed Training Network (DTN) which consists of federated learning Self-Attention Saliency Gated Recurrent Units (SAS-GRU) in which the training is collaboratively shared among the edges while maintaining video data privacy. 3) Finally the extracted deep features are summarized in the cloud for processing. Using various datasets and NVIDIA Nano Boards as edge nodes, the substantial research is conducted to develop the Google Federated TensorFlow Libraries-based federated learning architecture. The performance was compared with other deep learning-based MVS systems to demonstrate the proposed framework's superiority over the state-of-the-art approaches, the experimental evaluation confirms the superior performance of the suggested model.

AB Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework to exploit massive data generated by edge devices in developing a common learning model while preserving the privacy of local data. In implementing FL over wireless networks, the participation of more devices is encouraged to alleviate the training inefficiency due to irregular local data but it tends to increase communication latency. To solve this problem, we address non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted by intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to accommodate more devices and tailor their channels favorably to the FL performance. For the FL with IRS-NOMA, we minimize the total latency by reducing the latency per training round dominated by local computation and uplink communication through optimization of IRS-NOMA strategies and improving the training efficiency under irregular local data through active device selection. We then propose an auction-based IRS allocation that utilizes the optimized total latency for the valuation of the IRSs when multiple base stations of different operators share their neighboring IRSs. Winner determination (WD) and payment methods are devised with multiple bids on IRS subsets in a way of maximizing social welfare. The results show that the proposed latency minimizing algorithm outperforms the benchmarks by improving both communication and training efficiency through device selection combined with IRS-NOMA optimization. In addition, the auction mechanism with the proposed WD outperforms the benchmarks, where the social welfare is improved by constructing each bid with the valuation on multiple IRSs and increasing the number of bids submitted.

AB The development of Industry 4.0 relies on emerging technologies of digital twin, machine learning, blockchain, and Internet of Things (IoT) to build autonomous self-configuring systems that maximize manufactory efficiency, precision, and accuracy. In this article, we propose a new distributed and secure digital twin-driven IIoT framework that integrates federated learning and directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain with sharding. The proposed framework includes three planes: 1) the data plane; 2) the blockchain plane; and 3) the digital twin plane. Specifically, the data plane performs federated learning through a set of cluster heads to train models at network edges for twin model construction. The blockchain plane, which supports sharding, utilizes a hierarchical consensus scheme based on DAG blockchain to verify both local model updates and global model updates. The digital twin plane is responsible for constructing and maintaining twin model. Then, an efficient resource scheduling scheme is designed by considering performance of both federated learning and DAG blockchain with sharding. Accordingly, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize long-term utility of the digital twin-driven IIoT. To cope with mapping error in the digital twin plane, a multiagent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) approach is developed to solve the optimization problem. Numerical results illustrate that comparing with traditional approach, the proposed MAPPO improves utility by about 37 %, and reduces time latency by about 14%. Moreover, it also can well adapt to the mapping error.

AB Over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) is a distributed machine learning technique where multiple devices collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their raw data with a central server. The devices exchange model updates concurrently over the air (OTA) and they are aggregated without the need for dedicated wireless resources for each device. A major challenge in OTA-FL is that edge devices are limited in their computation, energy, and communication resources. To address this, we investigate how deep neural network compression techniques can be applied in an OTA-FL system. We propose a compression pipeline composed of pruning and quantization-aware training (QAT) that significantly reduces both the computation and communication requirements while maintaining an on-par accuracy to the uncompressed models. We thoroughly investigate the reduction in model size, accuracy, and convergence when pruning and QAT are applied individually and collectively at multiple pruning and quantization levels. Detailed experiments are conducted on two different deep learning models and two different data sets, and under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and numbers of clients. We then thoroughly present and discuss the resulting tradeoffs and findings. Our results demonstrate that deep compression is very effective in an OTA-FL system and negligible losses in accuracy are possible while maintaining up to 80% reductions in model size.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are envisioned to support extensive applications in next-generation wireless networks in both civil and military fields. Empowering UAV networks' intelligence with artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), techniques, is inevitable and appealing to enable the aforementioned applications. To solve the problems of traditional cloud-centric ML for UAV networks such as privacy concerns, unacceptable latency, and resource burden, a distributed ML technique, federated learning (FL), recently has been proposed to enable multiple UAVs to collaboratively train an ML model without letting out raw data. However, almost all existing FL paradigms are still centralized (i.e., a central entity is in charge of ML model aggregation and fusion over the whole network), which could result in the issue of a single point of failure and are inappropriate to UAV networks with both unreliable nodes and links. Thus motivated, in this article, we propose a novel architecture called Decentralized Federated Learning for UAV Networks (DFL-UN), which enables FL within UAV networks without a central entity. We also conduct a preliminary simulation study to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the DFLUN architecture. Finally, we discuss the main challenges and potential research directions in the DFL-UN.

TI Federated Freeze BERT for text classification

AB Pre-trained BERT models have demonstrated exceptional performance in the context of text classification tasks. Certain problem domains necessitate data distribution without data sharing. Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collectively train a global model by sharing learned models rather than raw data. However, the adoption of BERT, a large model, within a Federated Learning framework incurs substantial communication costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, FedFreezeBERT, for BERT-based text classification. FedFreezeBERT works by adding an aggregation architecture on top of BERT to obtain better sentence embedding for classification while freezing BERT parameters. Keeping the model parameters frozen, FedFreezeBERT reduces the communication costs by a large factor compared to other state-of-the-art methods. FedFreezeBERT is implemented in a distributed version where the aggregation architecture only is being transferred and aggregated by FL algorithms such as FedAvg or FedProx. FedFreezeBERT is also implemented in a centralized version where the data embeddings extracted by BERT are sent to the central server to train the aggregation architecture. The experiments show that FedFreezeBERT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on Arabic sentiment analysis on the ArSarcasm-v2 dataset with a 12.9% and 1.2% improvement over FedAvg/FedProx and the previous SOTA respectively. FedFreezeBERT also reduces the communication cost by 5x\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\times$$\end{document} compared to the previous SOTA.

AB In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient federated learning (FL) framework for the energy-constrained devices over cloud radio access network (Cloud-RAN), where each device adopts quantized neural networks (QNNs) to train a local FL model and transmits the quantized model parameter to the remote radio heads (RRHs). Each RRH receives the signals from devices over the wireless link and forwards the signals to the server via the fronthaul link. We rigorously develop an energy consumption model for the local training at devices through the use of QNNs and communication models over Cloud-RAN. Based on the proposed energy consumption model, we formulate an energy minimization problem that optimizes the fronthaul rate allocation, device transmit power allocation, and QNN precision levels while satisfying the limited fronthaul capacity constraint and ensuring the convergence of the proposed FL model to a target accuracy. To solve this problem, we analyze the convergence rate and propose efficient algorithms based on the alternative optimization technique. Simulation results show that the proposed FL framework can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to other conventional approaches. We draw the conclusion that the proposed framework holds great potential for achieving a sustainable and environmentally-friendly FL in Cloud-RAN.

AB Gas hydrates, crystalline structures formed under specific conditions, have drawn substantial research interest in both flow assurance risks and promising applications. Accurately predicting their equilibrium conditions in the presence of thermodynamic inhibitors is crucial for safety and economic risks, especially in flow assurance and deep-water drilling operations. Traditional machine learning (ML) methods assume independent and identically distributed (IID) data collected from various experiments, which is often violated due to distinct conditions, chemicals, and protocols used in different gas hydrate formation experiments. This results in non-IID data with varying local distributions, making conventional ML models less effective and leading to performance degradation. This paper introduces an innovative Customized Federated Kernel Regression (CFKR) learning framework to address these challenges. CFKR customizes individual models on each experiment's local data and establishes a novel collaboration strategy to capture similarities among various hydrate formation experiments' local data. A comprehensive literature review collected data from 40 experiments on the impact of four categories of thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors (THIs): salts, alcohols, ionic liquids, and amino acids. The proposed CFKR framework demonstrated superior performance in predicting natural gas hydrate formation temperature and pressure compared to twelve ML algorithms across five evaluation metrics. For hydrate formation temperature prediction, CFKR achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.9849 and a root mean squared error of 0.2367. For hydrate formation pressure prediction, CFKR obtained 0.9359 and 0.9512 for the coefficient of determination and root mean squared error, respectively.

AB With the continuous maturity and development of the big data technology system, deep learning has been widely used in the field of the Industrial Internet of Things. However, the traditional training model with centralized data is prone to the leakage of private information in the industry, such as facial information. In recent years, federated learning solves the problem of privacy leakage caused by data sharing by not sharing data and only contributing to local models. Federated learning does not share data, which also makes it impossible to evaluate the contribution of each client to the federated task. We propose a federated learning framework based on data value evaluation. In this method, under the premise of effectively completing the training task of federated learning and ensuring the privacy of client data, a data value evaluator is designed in the central server, and the model uploaded by the client is evaluated to obtain the corresponding selection probability as the model aggregation weight. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of the global model obtained by existing federated aggregation.

AB In 6G systems, it will be mandatory that the network is able to support edge computing powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide mobile devices with the opportunity of job offloading for computation, so implementing the new paradigm of Intelligent Internet of Intelligent Things (IIoIT). In areas that are very difficult to be covered by the structured networks, Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANET) can be considered one of the most promising technologies to enhance coverage, capacity, reliability, and energy efficiency of wireless cellular networks, also providing edge-computing services. The goal of this paper is to propose a two-layer Hierarchical Horizontal-Offload ManagEment (H-HOME) framework for horizontal offload among the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) of the same FANET, in order to minimize processing delay and jitter. The framework exploits Federated Reinforcement Learning in order to take advantage of knowledge sharing without incurring into problems of privacy and network overloading. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is also defined to optimize decisions of the FANET Orchestrator (FO). Simulation results, obtained from two different analyses, demonstrate that H-HOME outperforms the traditional local training approach, based on simple recursive learning, and it can be effectively used to reduce power consumption and increase FANETs flight autonomy.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) revitalizes the world with tremendous capabilities and potential to be utilized in vehicular networks. The Smart Transport Infrastructure (STI) era depends mainly on the IoT. Advanced machine learning (ML) techniques are being used to strengthen the STI smartness further. However, some decisions are very challenging due to the vast number of STI components and big data generated from STIs. Computation cost, communication overheads, and privacy issues are significant concerns for wide-scale ML adoption within STI. These issues can be addressed using Federated Learning (FL) and blockchain. FL can be used to address the issues of privacy preservation and handling big data generated in STI management and control. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that can store data while providing trust and integrity assurance. Blockchain can be a solution to data integrity and can add more security to the STI. This survey initially explores the vehicular network and STI in detail and sheds light on the blockchain and FL with real-world implementations. Then, FL and blockchain applications in the Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) environment from security and privacy perspectives are discussed in detail. In the end, the paper focuses on the current research challenges and future research directions related to integrating FL and blockchain for vehicular networks.

AB Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) regression plays an important role in the integrative analysis of different but interrelated systems/units. Existing MGP approaches assume that data from all units is collected and stored at a central location. This requires massive computing and storage power at the central location, induces significant communication traffic due to raw data exchange, and comprises privacy of units. However, recent advances in Internet of Things technologies, which have tremendously increased edge computing power, pose a significant opportunity to address such challenges. In this article, we propose FedMGP, a general federated analytics (FA) framework to learn an MGP in a decentralized manner that uses edge computing power to distribute model learning efforts. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical modeling approach where an MGP is built upon shared global latent functions. We then develop a variational inference FA algorithm that overcomes the need to share raw data. Instead, collaborative learning is achieved by only sharing global latent function statistics. Comprehensive simulation studies and a case study on battery degradation data highlight the superior predictive performance and versatility of FedMGP, achieved while distributing computing and storage demands, reducing communication burden, fostering privacy, and personalizing analysis.

AB Benefit from the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and wireless communication technology, diverse Internet of Things (IoT) devices with edge computing ability have widely penetrated every aspect of daily human life. However, the deviations of private datasets and the heterogeneity of local models caused by the difference in device composition and application scenarios have hampering the aggregation of global recognition model in modulation classification task, thus constraining the classification performance of intelligent IoT-edge devices severely. To address this problem, we propose a heterogenous Federated learning framework based on Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD) for IoT system, which integrates knowledge distillation into the local model upload (client-to-cloud) and global model download (cloud-to-client) steps of federated learning. The client-to-cloud distillation is regarded as a process of multi-teacher knowledge distillation and the global network is regarded as a student network that unifies the heterogeneous knowledge from multiple local teacher networks. A public dataset is generated by conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and stored in the cloud server for supporting the obtaining of heterogeneous knowledge without sharing the private data of IoT devices. The cloud-to-client distillation is single-teacher-multiple-students process, which distills the knowledge from the single global model back to multiple heterogeneous local networks and partial knowledge distillation is used in this process. We implement our FedBKD method in the modulation classification task and the simulation results have proven the effectiveness of our proposed method.

AB Federated learning (FL) is widely adopted in traffic forecasting tasks involving large-scale IoT-enabled sensor data since its decentralization nature enables data providers' privacy to be preserved. When employing state-of-the-art deep learning-based traffic predictors in FL systems, the existing FL frameworks confront overlarge communication overhead when transmitting these models' parameter updates since the modeling depth and breadth renders them incorporating an enormous number of parameters. In this article, we propose a practical FL scheme, namely, Clustering-based hierarchical and Two-step-optimized FL (CTFed), to tackle this issue. The proposed scheme follows a divide et impera strategy that clusters the clients into multiple groups based on the similarity between their local models' parameters. We integrate the particle swarm optimization algorithm and devises a two-step approach for local model optimization. This scheme enables only one but representative local model update from each cluster to be uploaded to the central server, thus reduces the communication overhead of the model updates transmission in FL. CTFed is orthogonal to the gradient compression- or sparsification-based approaches so that they can orchestrate to optimize the communication overhead. Extensive case studies on three real-world data sets and three state-of-the-art models demonstrate the outstanding training efficiency, accurate prediction performance, and robustness to unstable network environments of the proposed scheme.

AB The rise of IoT networks has presented fresh challenges in terms of scalability and security for distributed Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) due to privacy concerns. While some progress has been made in addressing these challenges, there are still unanswered questions regarding how to achieve a balance between performance and robustness to ensure privacy in a distributed manner. Additionally, there is a need to develop a reliable and scalable architecture for distributed NIDS that can be effectively deployed in various IoT scenarios. These questions about robustness relied mainly on choosing privacy-secured and distributed Machine Learning techniques. In this work, we propose the F-NIDS, an intrusion detector that utilizes federated artificial intelligence and asynchronous communication techniques between system entities to provide horizontal scalability, along with differential privacy techniques to address data confidentiality concerns. The architecture of F-NIDS is designed to be adaptable for usage in IoT networks, suited to be used in cloud or fog-based environments. Results from our experiments have shown that the confidential detection model employed in F-NIDS - considering multi-class accuracy, binary accuracy, precision, and recall metrics - was capable of predicting and determining the nature of attacks when they occur. In order to determine optimal parameters that strike a balance between data privacy and classification performance, three strategies were employed, each evaluated for its corresponding robustness performance. Firstly, models were trained with varying Gaussian noise values, and subjected to membership inference black box rule-based attacks. Secondly, regular membership inference black box attacks were performed, utilizing different stolen samples with varying sizes to determine the maximum amount of data that could be securely stored on the detection agents for training tasks. Lastly, the robustness of the trained models was evaluated against a model inversion attack, and the results were compared through graphical comparisons. Based on these evaluations, Gaussian noise level and sample size values of 21 were obtained for each detection agent in the system, with sample sizes ranging from 10K to 25K.

AB Federated learning (FL), celebrated for its privacy-preserving features, has been revealed by recent studies to harbour security vulnerabilities that jeopardize client privacy, particularly through data reconstruction attacks that enable adversaries to recover original client data. This study introduces a client-level handwriting forgery attack method for FL based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), which reveals security vulnerabilities existing in FL systems. It should be stressed that this research is purely for academic purposes, aiming to raise concerns about privacy protection and data security, and does not encourage illegal activities. Our novel methodology assumes an adversarial scenario wherein adversaries intercept a fraction of parameter updates via victim clients' wireless communication channels, then use this information to train GAN for data recovery. Finally, the purpose of handwriting imitation is achieved. To rigorously assess and validate our methodology, experiments were conducted using a bespoke Chinese digit dataset, facilitating in-depth analysis and robust verification of results. Our experimental findings demonstrated enhanced data recovery effectiveness, a client-level attack and greater versatility compared to prior art. Notably, our method maintained high attack performance even with a streamlined GAN design, yielding increased precision and significantly faster execution times compared to standard methods. Specifically, our experimental numerical results revealed a substantial boost in reconstruction accuracy by 16.7%, coupled with a 51.9% decrease in computational time compared to the latest similar techniques. Furthermore, tests on a simplified version of our GAN exhibited an average 10% enhancement in accuracy, alongside a remarkable 70% reduction in time consumption. By surmounting the limitations of previous work, this study fills crucial gaps and affirms the effectiveness of our approach in achieving high-accuracy client-level data reconstruction within the FL context, thereby stimulating further exploration into FL security measures.

AB The increase in the computational power of edge devices has opened up the possibility of processing some of the data at the edge and distributing model learning. This paradigm is often called federated learning (FL), where edge devices exploit their local computational resources to train models collaboratively. Though FL has seen recent success, it is unclear how to characterize uncertainties in FL predictions. In this paper, we propose Fed-ensemble: a simple approach that brings model ensembling to FL. Instead of aggregating local models to update a single global model, Fed-ensemble uses random permutations to update a group of K models and then obtains predictions through model averaging. Fed-ensemble can be readily utilized within established FL methods and does not impose a computational overhead compared with single-model methods. Empirical results show that our model has superior performance over several FL algorithms on a wide range of data sets and excels in heterogeneous settings often encountered in FL applications. Also, by carefully choosing client-dependent weights in the inference stage, Fed-ensemble becomes personalized and yields even better performance. Theoretically, we show that predictions on new data from all K models belong to the same predictive posterior distribution under a neural tangent kernel regime. This result, in turn, sheds light on the generalization advantages of model averaging and justifies the uncertainty quantification capability. We also illustrate that Fed-ensemble has an elegant Bayesian interpretation. Note to Practitioners-Fed-ensemble provides an algorithm that extracts a set of K solutions without imposing any additional communication overhead in FL. Given multiple solutions, Fedensemble can be exploited to personalize inference as well as quantify uncertainty. Such capabilities may be beneficial within multiple practical systems that require uncertainty-aware decision-making. Further, Fed-ensemble may be useful for model validation and hypothesis testing.

AB The emerging paradigm of federated learning (FL) strives to enable devices to cooperatively train models without exposing their raw data. In most cases, the data across devices are non-independently and identically distributed in FL. Thus, the local models trained over different data distributions will inevitably deviate from the global optima, which induces optimization inconsistency and even hurts global convergence. Moreover, the resource-constrained devices with heterogeneous training capacities (e.g., computing and communication) further slow down the convergence rate. To this end, we introduce an FL framework with adaptive data sampling and local training, namely FAST. Specifically, even without devices' private data distributions, FAST enables each device to sample different rates of data points from each of its local classes to rebuild a dataset for training, thus adjusting the convergence direction of the aggregated global model to be closer to the global optima. The theoretical analysis shows that the convergence bound depends on the sampling rates as well as the number of local iterations executed on the sampled data. To achieve resource-effective and convergence-guaranteed FL, we then design an online learning algorithm that jointly optimizes the data sampling and local training strategies so as to encourage the decrease of global loss under the given time budget. Extensive experiments on physical and simulated environments show that, FAST improves the model accuracy by about 1.55%-6.78% given the same time budget, and accelerates training by about 1.39-5.89x with the same target accuracy, compared with the baselines.

AB Federated learning is increasingly being considered for sensor-driven human activity recognition, offering advantages in terms of privacy and scalability compared to centralized methods. However, challenges such as feature selection and client imbalanced data persist. In this study, FLP-DS2MOTE-USA is suggested, a system that integrates federated local preprocessing, adaptive thresholding based on uncertainty symmetry, and a density- sensitive synthetic minority over-sampling approach. Each client preprocesses data locally and employs DS2MOTE for class balancing. On the server side, adaptive thresholding based on uncertainty symmetry is utilized to identify the optimal client for training the global mode. Evaluation on two distinct datasets-Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones and Human Activity Recognition (OpenPose) -reveals that our model outperforms FedAvg, FedSgd, FedSmote, and FedNova, achieving accuracies of 90.57% and 96.58%, respectively. In addition, FLP-DS2MOTE-USA minimizes update size and network overhead on the Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones, while achieving improvements on the OpenPose dataset. Overall, the proposed method not only addresses issues of imbalanced data but also reduces computational complexity via streamlined local preprocessing, and server-side mechanisms ensure client privacy. It outperforms traditional federated learning techniques in both accuracy and efficiency.

AB Federated learning (FL) is the up-to-date approach for privacy constraints Internet of Things (IoT) applications in next-generation mobile network (NGMN), 5th generation (5G), and 6th generation (6G), respectively. Due to 5G/6G is based on new radio (NR) technology, the multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) of radio services for heterogeneous IoT devices have been performed. The autonomous resource allocation and the intelligent quality of service class identity (IQCI) in mobile networks based on FL systems are obligated to meet the requirements of privacy constraints of IoT applications. In massive FL communications, the heterogeneous local devices propagate their local models and parameters over 5G/6G networks to the aggregation servers in edge cloud areas. Therefore, the assurance of network reliability is compulsory to facilitate end-to-end (E2E) reliability of FL communications and provide the satisfaction of model decisions. This paper proposed an intelligent lightweight scheme based on the reference software-defined networking (SDN) architecture to handle the massive FL communications between clients and aggregators to meet the mentioned perspectives. The handling method adjusts the model parameters and batches size of the individual client to reflect the apparent network conditions classified by the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. The proposed system showed notable experimented metrics, including the E2E FL communication latency, throughput, system reliability, and model accuracy.

AB This article addresses the challenge of communication efficiency in federated learning by the proposed algorithm called global sparsification with adaptive aggregated stochastic gradients (GSASGs). GSASG leverages the advantages of local sparse communication, global sparsification communication, and adaptive aggregated gradients. More specifically, we devise an efficient global top- k ' sparsification operator. By applying this operator to the aggregated gradients obtained from the top-k sparsification, the global model parameter is rarefied to reduce the download transmitted bits from O(dMT)$ to O(k ' MT), where d is the dimension of the gradient, M is the number of workers, T is the total number of epochs, and k ' <= k <= d. Meanwhile, the adaptive aggregated gradient method is adopted to skip meaningless communication and reduce communication rounds. The deep neural network training experiment demonstrates that, compared to the previous algorithms GSASG significantly reduces communication cost without sacrificing the model performance. For instance, when considering the MNIST data set with k=1% d and k '=0.5%d, in terms of communication rounds, GSASG outperforms sparse communication by 91%, adaptive aggregated gradients by 90%, and the combination of sparse communication with adaptive aggregated gradients by 56%. In terms of communication bits, GSASG yields 1% of the communication bits needed with previous algorithms.

AB With the increasing demand for application development of task publishers (e.g., automobile enterprises) in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), federated learning (FL) can be used to enable vehicle users (VUs) to conduct local application training without disclosing data. However, the challenges of VUs' intermittent connectivity, low proactivity, and limited resources are inevitable issues in the process of FL. In this paper, we propose a UAV-assisted FL framework in the context of the IoV. An incentive stage and a training stage are involved in this framework. UAVs serve as central servers, which assist to incentivize VUs, manage VUs' contributed resources, and provide model aggregation, making sure communication efficiency and mobility enhancement in FL. The numerical results show that, compared with the baseline algorithms, the proposed algorithm reduces energy consumption by 50.3% and improves model convergence speed by 30.6%.

AB In the foreseeable Intelligent Transportation System, Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) will play an important role in improving travel efficiency and safety. However, it is challenging for ICVs to support the resource-hungry autonomous driving applications due to the limitation of hardware computing power. Fortunately, the emergence of Multi-access Edge Computing helps overcome this limitation effectively. This paper addresses the vehicle-to-edge server computation offloading conundrum by optimizing the trade-offs in partial offloading and resource allocation. Proposing a distributed approach, this study confronts the multi-variable non-convex challenge directly by decoupling variables and deriving constraint-based bounds that guide the decisions for offloading and allocation. A novel low-complexity distributed algorithm is introduced that not only tends toward optimal but also demonstrates superior real-time applicability and efficiency, illustrated through enhanced performances both in simulated trials and genuine vehicular edge computing settings. The algorithm's practical effectiveness addresses a notable gap between the theoretical models for computation offloading and actual real-life execution, reinforcing the soundness and relevance of the proposed method. Furthermore, its advanced integration with federated learning frameworks marks a leading-edge application, substantiating significant enhancements in computational efficiency and robustness.

AB Purpose In the cold supply chain (SC), effective risk management is regarded as an essential component to address the risky and uncertain SC environment in handling time- and temperature-sensitive products. However, existing multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches greatly rely on expert opinions for pairwise comparisons. Despite the fact that machine learning models can be customised to conduct pairwise comparisons, it is difficult for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to intelligently measure the ratings between risk criteria without sufficiently large datasets. Therefore, this paper aims at developing an enterprise-wide solution to identify and assess cold chain risks. Design/methodology/approach A novel federated learning (FL)-enabled multi-criteria risk evaluation system (FMRES) is proposed, which integrates FL and the best-worst method (BWM) to measure firm-level cold chain risks under the suggested risk hierarchical structure. The factors of technologies and equipment, operations, external environment, and personnel and organisation are considered. Furthermore, a case analysis of an e-grocery SC in Australia is conducted to examine the feasibility of the proposed approach. Findings Throughout this study, it is found that embedding the FL mechanism into the MCDM process is effective in acquiring knowledge of pairwise comparisons from experts. A trusted federation in a cold chain network is therefore formulated to identify and assess cold SC risks in a systematic manner. Originality/value A novel hybridisation between horizontal FL and MCDM process is explored, which enhances the autonomy of the MCDM approaches to evaluate cold chain risks under the structured hierarchy.

AB Solder paste printing (SPP) is one of the critical processes for the printed circuit board assembly to reliably apply the solder paste on raw PCBs for the component placement through surface mount technology. Although computerised SPP machines have been developed in the past few years, the reliance on domain experts cannot be neglected to fine-tune corresponding process parameters so as to maintain productivity and quality. This study exploits federated learning on the industrial internet of things (IIoT) paradigm to establish an intelligent decision support system across various networked machines. The IIoT-based squeegee blade is deployed in the SPP machines for better machine-to-machine communication and interconnectivity. In contrast, a global machine intelligence model is aggregated in a decentralised and privacy-preserving manner. Consequently, the automated and sustainable manufacturing management for PCBA is achieved, where wastes from trial production runs are eliminated.

AB Due to privacy issues, the data island problem of machine fault diagnosis widely exists in real industry. Federated learning (FL) has received much attention as a decentralized machine-learning paradigm that learns a global model in the server by iteratively aggregating the local model parameters in a privacy-preserving scheme to address the data island problem. However, the fault data in industry is inevitably scarce and class imbalanced, so the fault data in different clients are heterogeneous from each other in FL. The existing federated machine fault diagnosis methods are mostly based on the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm, which ignores the data heterogeneity issue for machine fault diagnosis. To address this issue for machine fault diagnosis, we propose a new model alignment method (called FedAlign) via data-free knowledge distillation, where a compact generator is trained in the server in a data-free manner to estimate the data feature distribution in a global view without access to the local data. Then, the generator can produce the pseudo features to convey the distribution knowledge to both the server and the client sides. Our proposed FedAlign utilizes the pseudo features to align the global model and the local models to finally address the inherent heterogeneity of local data for fault diagnosis in FL. Experiments performed on fault diagnosis datasets of nonidentically and independently (non-iid) settings indicate that our proposed method facilitates FL for machine fault diagnosis with favorable effectiveness and achieves significant performance gains compared with state-of-the-art methods.

AB In modern society, the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) is continuously increasing, presenting new challenges that necessitate integration with smart grids. The operational data from electric vehicles are voluminous, and the secure storage and management of these data are crucial for the efficient operation of the power grid. This paper proposes a novel system that utilizes blockchain technology to securely store and manage the black box data of electric vehicles. By leveraging the core characteristics of blockchain-immutability and transparency-the system records the operational data of electric vehicles and uses federated learning (FL) to predict their energy consumption based on these data. This approach allows the balanced management of the power grid's load, optimization of energy supply, and maintenance of grid stability while reducing costs. Additionally, the paper implements a searchable black box data storage system using a public blockchain, which offers cost efficiency and robust anonymity, thereby enhancing convenience for electric vehicle users and strengthening the stability of the power grid. This research presents an innovative approach to the integration of electric vehicles and smart grids, exploring ways to enhance the stability and energy efficiency of the power grid. The proposed system has been validated through real data and simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness and performance in managing black box data and predicting energy consumption, thereby improving the efficiency and stability of the power grid. This system is expected to empower electric vehicle users with data ownership and provide power suppliers with more accurate energy demand predictions, promoting sustainable energy consumption and efficient power grid operations.

AB Cross-device federated learning (FL) enables the privacy-preserving and collaborative training of machine learning models across heterogeneous clients. To prevent gradient information leakage, homomorphic encryption (HE) has been widely utilized due to its strong protection without losing accuracy. However, our experiments demonstrate that for clients with heterogeneous data and system capabilities, previous plain HE methods (i.e., encryption applied per gradient) and batch HE methods (i.e., encryption applied per batch of gradients) either significantly prolong training time or suffer from accuracy loss due to gradient quantization. We propose an adaptive batch HE framework for cross-device FL, which determines cost-efficient and sufficiently secure encryption strategies for clients with heterogeneous data and system capabilities. By leveraging the sparsity of convolutional neural networks for privacy-preserving similarity measurement of clients' data, we first split the clients with similar data into their respective clusters. Then, we develop a fuzzy logic-based method to determine a cost-efficient and sufficiently secure HE key size for each client corresponding to its system capability, and arrange the clients with identical key size to the same groups. Finally, we design an efficient batch encryption approach for accuracy-lossless model aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple heterogeneity scenarios demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable accuracy to plain HE, while reducing training time by 3x - 31x , and communication cost by 45x - 66x.

AB Federated learning is a branch of machine learning where a shared model is created in a decentralized and privacy-preserving fashion, but existing approaches using blockchain are limited by tailored models. We consider the possibility to extend a set of supported models by introducing the oracle service and exploring the usability of blockchain-based architecture. The investigated architecture combines an oracle service with a Hyperledger Fabric chaincode. We compared two logistic regression implementations in Go language-a pure chaincode and an oracle service-at various data (2-32 k instances) and network (3-13 peers) sizes. Experiments were run to assess the performance of blockchain-based model inference using 2D synthetic and EEG eye state datasets for a supervised machine learning detection task. The benchmarking results showed that the impact on performance is acceptable with the median overhead of oracle service reaching 2-4%, depending on the dimensionality of the dataset. The overhead tends to diminish at large dataset sizes with the runtime depending on the network size linearly, where additional peers increased the runtime by 6.3 and 6.6 s for 2D and EEG datasets, respectively. Demonstrated negligible difference between implementations justifies the flexible choice of model in the blockchain-based federated learning and other machine learning applications.

AB The development of artificial intelligence and worldwide epidemic events has promoted the implementation of smart healthcare while bringing issues of data privacy, malicious attack, and service quality. The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), along with the technologies of federated learning and blockchain, has become a feasible solution for these issues. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based federated learning method for smart healthcare in which the edge nodes maintain the blockchain to resist a single point of failure and MIoT devices implement the federated learning to make full of the distributed clinical data. In particular, we design an adaptive differential privacy algorithm to protect data privacy and gradient verification-based consensus protocol to detect poisoning attacks. We compare our method with two similar methods on a real-world diabetes dataset. Promising experimental results show that our method can achieve high model accuracy in acceptable running time while also showing good performance in reducing the privacy budget consumption and resisting poisoning attacks.

AB Multi-view learning aims to explore a global common structure shared by different views collected from multiple individual sources. The nascent field of federated learning tries to learn a global model over distributed networks of devices. This paper shows that multi-view learning is naturally suited to address the feature heterogeneity of the federated setting. We propose a novel model, namely robust federated multi-view learning (FedMVL), which is considered in the following formulation: given a dataset with M views, it is required to train machine learning models while the M views are distributed across M devices or nodes. Considering the unique challenges like stragglers and fault tolerance in federated setting, we derive an iterative federated optimization algorithm that allows each node with the flexibility to approximately address its subproblem. To the best of our knowledge, our model for the first time considers the issues including high communication cost, fault tolerance, and stragglers for distributed multi-view learning. The proposed model also achieves encouraging performance on clustering task compared to closely related methods, as we illustrate through simulations on several real-world datasets.

AB Most real-world data are scattered across different companies or government organizations, and cannot be easily integrated under data privacy and related regulations such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and China' Cyber Security Law. Such data islands situation and data privacy & security are two major challenges for applications of artificial intelligence. In this article, we tackle these challenges and propose a privacy-preserving machine learning model, called Federated Forest, which is a lossless learning model of the traditional random forest method, i.e., achieving the same level of accuracy as the non-privacy-preserving approach. Based on it, we developed a secure cross-regional machine learning system that allows a learning process to be jointly trained over different regions' clients with the same user samples but different attribute sets, processing the data stored in each of them without exchanging their raw data. A novel prediction algorithm was also proposed which could largely reduce the communication overhead. Experiments on both real-world and UCI data sets demonstrate the performance of the Federated Forest is as accurate as of the non-federated version. The efficiency and robustness of our proposed system had been verified. Overall, our model is practical, scalable and extensible for real-life tasks.

AB With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, smart services have penetrated into every aspect of our daily lives, including the medical treatment and healthcare fields. However, due to security and privacy issues, medical data cannot be easily shared, which may lead to the situation of the so-called data silos. Challenges in existing approaches when building medical data sharing models can be summarized as: i) It is very challenging to ensure that the privacy of the medical data is protected and to identify the ownership of medical data; ii) Their models always result in poor performance or have the problem of excessive communication overhead due to the large amount of model parameters; iii) The current scenario of combining federated learning and blockchain generally ignores the load on nodes, which may easily lead to a lack of efficiency and fairness during the consensus process. In this study, we propose a Federated Distillation and Blockchain empowered Secure Knowledge Sharing (FDBC-SKS) model, which transforms the data sharing problem into a collaborative model knowledge sharing problem, aiming to provide a lightweight distributed deep learning framework in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) environments. A peer-to-peer federated distillation mechanism is designed to enable a decentralized federated learning with better model flexibility and less communication consumption, based on the better knowledge utilization from each local model. A reinforcement learning enhanced consensus mechanism for blockchain is devised to improve the model convergence performance, alleviate the problem of low computational efficiency, while enhancing the fairness in terms of node load balancing during the node selection and block generation process. Experiment and evaluation results based on two realworld datasets demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed model toward secure and effective data sharing in IoMT oriented smart application development compared with other similar methods.

AB Recently, artificial intelligence approaches are widely suggested to optimize numerous offloading task-scheduling purposes. However, they confront difficulties in maintaining data privacy regarding the context of the data offloading during the course of offloading in the different stages. To address this problem, in this article we propose C-fDRL, a framework to provide context-aware federated deep reinforcement learning (fDRL) to maintain the context-aware privacy of the task offloading. We perform this in three stages (CloudAI, EdgeAI, and DeviceAI) of the overall system. C-fDRL checks whether the privacy of high-context-aware data with the task being offloaded is maintained locally at the DeviceAI, and low-context-aware data distributedly at the EdgeAI. When there is an offloading task request or a user needs to offload the data, C-fDRL uses a context-aware data management approach to decouple the context-aware (privacy) data from the tasks. This separates the context-aware data from the task for local computation and allows a new scheduling technique called "context-aware multilevel scheduler. " This places high-context-aware data on local devices and low-context-aware data at the edge device for computation before the actual task execution. We performed experiments to evaluate the data privacy with the offloading tasks and the federated DRL. The results show that the proposed C-fDRL performs better than the existing framework.

AB This letter studies a vertical federated edge learning (FEEL) system for collaborative objects/human motion recognition by exploiting the distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). In this system, distributed edge devices first send wireless signals to sense targeted objects/human, and then exchange intermediate computed vectors (instead of raw sensing data) for collaborative recognition while preserving data privacy. To boost the spectrum and hardware utilization efficiency for FEEL, we exploit ISAC for both target sensing and data exchange, by employing dedicated frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) signals at each edge device. Under this setup, we propose a vertical FEEL scheme for realizing the recognition based on the collected multi-view wireless sensing data. In this scheme, each edge device owns an individual local L-model to transform its sensing data into an intermediate vector with relatively low dimensions, which is then transmitted to a coordinating edge device for final output via a common downstream S-model. By considering a human motion recognition task, experimental results show that our vertical FEEL based approach achieves recognition accuracy up to 98% with an improvement up to 8% compared to the benchmarks, including on-device training and horizontal FEEL.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated our daily lives, leaving horrific repercussions in its aftermath. Due to its rapid spread, it was quite difficult for medical personnel to diagnose it in such a big quantity. Patients who test positive for Covid-19 are diagnosed via a nasal PCR test. In com-parison, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) findings take a few hours to a few days. The PCR test is expensive, although the government may bear expenses in certain places. Furthermore, subsets of the population resist invasive testing like swabs. Therefore, chest X-rays or Computerized Vomography (CT) scans are preferred in most cases, and more importantly, they are non-invasive, inexpensive, and provide a faster response time. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), in combination with state-of-the-art methods, have allowed for the diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest x-rays. This article proposes a method for classifying COVID-19 as positive or negative on a decentralized dataset that is based on the Federated learning scheme. In order to build a progressive global COVID-19 classification model, two edge devices are employed to train the model on their respective localized dataset, and a 3 -layered custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is used in the process of training the model, which can be deployed from the server. These two edge devices then communicate their learned parameter and weight to the server, where it aggregates and updates the global model. The proposed model is trained using an image dataset that can be found on Kaggle. There are more than 13,000 X-ray images in Kaggle Database collection, from that collection 9000 images of Normal and COVID-19 positive images are used. Each edge node possesses a different number of images; edge node 1 has 3200 images, while edge node 2 has 5800. There is no association between the datasets of the various nodes that are included in the network. By doing it in this manner, each of the nodes will have access to a separate image collection that has no correlation with each other. The diagnosis of COVID-19 has become considerably more efficient with the installation of the suggested algorithm and dataset, and the findings that we have obtained are quite encouraging.

AB Although remarkable progress has been made by existing federated learning (FL) platforms to provide infrastructures for development, these platforms may not well tackle the challenges brought by various types of heterogeneity. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel FL platform, named FederatedScope, which employs an event-driven architecture to provide users with great flexibility to independently describe the behaviors of different participants. Such a design makes it easy for users to describe participants with various local training processes, learning goals and backends, and coordinate them into an FL course with synchronous or asynchronous training strategies. Towards an easy-to-use and flexible platform, FederatedScope enables rich types of plug-in operations and components for efficient further development, and we have implemented several important components to better help users with privacy protection, attack simulation and auto-tuning. We have released FederatedScope at https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope to promote academic research and industrial deployment of federated learning in a wide range of scenarios.

AB Energy-efficient federated learning (FL) is important for decentralized learning-based edge computing. The energy consumption of FL is largely affected by the efficiency of local training in edge devices and their communication efficiency to the central server. The majority of studies have focused on improving the latter while continuing to use traditional neural networks for local training. This can be computationally heavy for edge devices, especially given their limited energy supply and computation capabilities. In this paper, we propose a joint lightweight design and energy-saving algorithm (LDES) for efficient FL training and parameter uploading in the wireless edge. In the lightweight design of LDES, we investigate lightweight models in local training by deploying sparse or binary neural networks (SNN or BNN) at the edge, in order to reduce the uploaded data volume and the energy consumption. We develop an enhanced stochastic gradient descent algorithm with guaranteed convergence to handle the issues of non-smoothness and weight constraints (NSC-SGD) in training sparse models. In the energy-optimization part of LDES, we optimize power, bandwidth, and learning parameters to jointly minimize computing, uploading, and broadcasting energy. The numerical results show that LDES can reduce 56.21% energy consumption compared to benchmark FL schemes.

AB Fintech is an industry that uses technology to enhance and automate financial services. Fintech firms use software, mobile apps, and digital technologies to provide financial services that are faster, more efficient, and more accessible than those provided by traditional banks and financial institutions. Fintech companies take care of processes such as lending, payment processing, personal finance, and insurance, among other financial services. A data breach refers to a security liability when unapproved individuals gain access to or pilfer susceptible data. Data breaches pose a significant financial, reputational, and legal liability for companies. In 2017, Equifax suffered a data breach that revealed the personal information of over 143 million customers. Combining federated learning (FL) and blockchain can provide financial institutions with additional insurance and safeguards. Blockchain technology can provide a transparent and secure platform for FL, allowing financial institutions to collaborate on machine learning (ML) models while maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of their data. Utilizing blockchain technology, FL can provide an immutable and auditable record of all transactions and data exchanges. This can ensure that all parties adhere to the protocols and standards agreed upon for data sharing and collaboration. We propose the implementation of an FL framework that uses multiple ML models to protect consumers against fraudulent transactions through blockchain. The framework is intended to preserve customer privacy because it does not mandate the exchange of private customer data between participating institutions. Each bank trains its local models using data from its consumers, which are then combined on a centralised federated server to produce a unified global model. Data is neither stored nor exchanged between institutions, while models are trained on each institution's data.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving paradigm for collaboratively training a global model from decentralized clients. However, the performance of FL is hindered by non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data and device heterogeneity. In this letter, we revisit this key challenge through the lens of gradient conflicts on the server side. Specifically, we first investigate the gradient conflict phenomenon among multiple clients and reveal that stronger heterogeneity leads to more severe gradient conflicts. To tackle this issue, we propose FedGH, a simple yet effective method that mitigates local drifts through Gradient Harmonization. This technique projects one gradient vector onto the orthogonal plane of the other within conflicting client pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedGH consistently enhances multiple state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse benchmarks and non-IID scenarios. Moreover, FedGH yields more significant improvements in scenarios with stronger heterogeneity. As a plug-and-play module, FedGH can seamlessly integrate into any FL framework without requiring hyperparameter tuning.

AB Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) shows promise as a distributed machine learning paradigm for the edge devices. By leveraging the superposition property of a multiple access channel (MAC), Air-FEEL can achieve low communication latency during training while enhancing the data privacy of the edge devices, though at the expense of compromised learning performance. Recent studies suggest that optimizing the convergence speed of Air-FEEL can be accomplished by regulating the transmission power of the edge devices while ensuring their differential privacy (DP). In this article, we advance by incorporating device sampling in Air-FEEL (Air-FEEL-DS) to improve privacy and reduce device energy consumption, where each edge device decides randomly and independently whether to participate in each training round. First, we theoretically characterize both the DP guarantee and convergence performance of Air-FEEL-DS. Then, we formulate a power control optimization problem to optimize the convergence speed while ensuring a specified DP guarantee. Despite the nonconvex nature of this problem, we propose an efficient algorithm by linking it to a variant, transforming the variant into a convex problem, and demonstrating that the convex problem accommodates an efficient waterfilling-like algorithm. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed power control scheme achieves much faster convergence for Air-FEEL-DS than the channel inversion method, and has close convergence performance with significantly lower energy consumption compared to the Air-FEEL with optimized power control but without device sampling.

AB Accurate wind power forecasting is one of the most important operations within the economic dispatch problem to increase the performance of power and energy systems. Accordingly, this study proposes a cyber-resilient hybrid approach based on the Federated Learning and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) procedure for short-term wind power generation forecasting in different regions of Iran. Generalizability, data independence, forecasting for regions where no training data is available, and preserving the security and privacy of data are prominent features of the proposed method. The federated network was designed with an architecture of 9 clients to perform the training process and extract the salient features from the data associated with each region in each client via the CNN technique. Then, the generalized global supermodel is produced based on the extracted features in each client to forecast the wind power in new and unknown regions such as Mahshahr, Bojnord, and Lootak that had no training data available and had no effect on global supermodel generation. Various scenarios were developed to test the robustness of the suggested methodology. In the first scenario, wind power forecasting is performed based on the suggested technique. In this scenario, the accuracy of the generalized supermodel to forecast wind power generation in each of the Mahshahr, Bojnord, and Lootak regions is 84%, 85%, and 74%, respectively. The second scenario models the scaling attack by changing the wind speed parameters to evaluate the performance of forecasting models against the data integrity attack. In this scenario, an evaluation of the forecast results based on various performance metrics is conducted highlighting the accuracy reduction of the forecast model, due to the damage caused by cyber-attacks on the input data. In the third scenario, the detection of cyber-attack is done based on the image processing-based technique. The presented results emphasize the accurate performance and high generalizability of the cyber-resilient global supermodel in forecasting wind power in various regions of Iran.

AB Distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) model training over mobile edge networks encounters significant challenges due to the data and resource heterogeneity of edge devices. The former hampers the convergence rate of the global model, while the latter diminishes the devices' resource utilization efficiency. In this paper, we propose a generative AI-empowered federated learning to address these challenges by leveraging the idea of FIlling the MIssing (FIMI) portion of local data. Specifically, FIMI can be considered as a resource-aware data augmentation method that effectively mitigates the data heterogeneity while ensuring efficient FL training. We first quantify the relationship between the training data amount and the learning performance. We then study the FIMI optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the device-side overall energy consumption subject to required learning performance constraints. The decomposition-based analysis and the cross-entropy searching method are leveraged to derive the solution, where each device is assigned suitable AI-synthetic data and resource utilization policy. Experiment results demonstrate that FIMI can save up to 50% of the device-side energy to achieve the target global test accuracy in comparison with the existing methods. Meanwhile, FIMI can significantly enhance the converged global accuracy under the non-independently-and-identically distribution (non-IID) data.

ID PREDICTION
AB Federated learning (FL)-based fault diagnosis is being widely developed. However, most of the existing FL methods may suffer from two drawbacks: 1) they are limited to a single diagnosis task, and this may be insufficient when comprehensive health status information is needed and 2) most of them work offline, thus neglecting the useful information contained in newly collected operation data. For this end, this article proposes a multitask federated incremental learning (multitask-FIL) framework. First of all, a multitask feature sharing network is established by assigning the extracted general features to different downstream tasks, so that the joint loss function is obtained for subsequent collaborative training. Then, Q-learning algorithm is used to select the incremental sequences for all the parties from real-time running data, which can facilitate the model performance by involving additional data information and preferred parties. After that, the incremental weight of each party is dynamically adjusted according to the loss depth and sample size in each round of communication, so that the effects of different parties can be quantified throughout the model iteration and aggregation process. Finally, experiments on three challenging cases are performed to show that the proposed method has strong multitask collaboration capability.

AB With the massive amounts of data generated by industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices at all moments, federated learning (FL) enables these distributed distrusted devices to collaborate to build machine learning model while maintaining data privacy. However, malicious participants still launch malicious attacks against the security vulnerabilities during model aggregation. This article is the first to propose Sybil-based collusion attacks (SCA) in the IIoT-FL system for the vulnerabilities mentioned above. The malicious participants use label flipping attacks to complete local poisoning training. Meanwhile, they can virtualize multiple Sybil nodes to make the local poisoning models aggregated with the greatest possibility during aggregation. They focus on making the joint model misclassify the selected attack class samples during the testing phase, while other nonattack classes kept the main task accuracy similar to the nonpoisoned state. Exhaustive experimental analysis demonstrates that our SCA has a superior performance on multiple aspects than the state-of-the-art.

TI FDRP: federated deep relationship prediction with sequential information

ID RECOMMENDATION
AB Social relationship prediction has garnered significant attention in the development of artificial intelligence technology due to its potential to promote socioeconomic development. Meantime, the increasing popularity and adoption of intelligent devices located in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment have generated abundant data, which can serve as a basis for social relationship prediction. Nevertheless, the highly fragmented distribution of user data and the implementation of data protection policies can lead to the dilemma of "data scarcity" during the process of social relationship prediction. The application of federated learning can effectively address data segregation and fragmentation. Additionally, existing studies on social relationship prediction fail to consider users' temporal sequence information. To this end, we present a novel Federated Deep Relationship Prediction framework, named FDRP, which adopts the principle of vertical federated learning. Specifically, under the IoT environment, the offline operation initially assigns virtual items and ratings to users. Subsequently, the online operation executes social relationship prediction, where the client converts the sparse data into dense vectors and extracts the overall temporal sequence features, as well as the server performs the model parameter aggregation. Through extensive experiments conducted on the Epinions dataset, FDRP demonstrates excellent prediction accuracy and convergence speed, effectively mitigating the risk of inference attacks.

AB This artilce aims to develop a differential private federated learning (FL) scheme with the least artificial noises added while minimizing the energy consumption of participating mobile devices. By observing that some communication efficient FL approaches and even the nature of wireless communications contribute to the differential privacy (DP) preservation of training data on mobile devices, in this paper, we propose to jointly leverage gradient compression techniques (i.e., gradient quantization and sparsification) and additive white Gaussian noises (AWGN) in wireless channels to develop a piggyback DP approach for FL over mobile devices. Even with the piggyback DP approach, information distortion caused by gradient compression and noise perturbation may slow down FL convergence, which in turn consumes more energy of mobile devices for local computing and model update communications. Thus, we theoretically analyze FL convergence and formulate an energy efficient FL optimization under piggyback DP, transmission power, and FL convergence constraints. Furthermore, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm where closed-form solutions for artificial DP noise and power control are derived. Extensive simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of energy efficiency and privacy preservation.

TI Dynamic Multi-Sleeping Control with Diverse Quality-of-Service
   Requirements in Sixth-Generation Networks Using Federated Learning

DT Article
DE 6G; network energy saving; base station sleeping; federated learning
AB The intensive deployment of sixth-generation (6G) base stations is expected to greatly enhance network service capabilities, offering significantly higher throughput and lower latency compared to previous generations. However, this advancement is accompanied by a notable increase in the number of network elements, leading to increased power consumption. This not only worsens carbon emissions but also significantly raises operational costs for network operators. To address the challenges arising from this surge in network energy consumption, there is a growing focus on innovative energy-saving technologies designed for 6G networks. These technologies involve strategies for dynamically adjusting the operational status of base stations, such as activating sleep modes during periods of low demand, to optimize energy use while maintaining network performance and efficiency. Furthermore, integrating artificial intelligence into the network's operational framework is being explored to establish a more energy-efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective 6G network. In this paper, we propose a small base station sleeping control scheme in heterogeneous dense small cell networks based on federated reinforcement learning, which enables the small base stations to dynamically enter appropriate sleep modes, to reduce power consumption while ensuring users' quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. In our scheme, double deep Q-learning is used to solve the complex non-convex base station sleeping control problem. To tackle the dynamic changes in QoS requirements caused by user mobility, small base stations share local models with the macro base station, which acts as the central control unit, via the X2 interface. The macro base station aggregates local models into a global model and then distributes the global model to each base station for the next round of training. By alternately performing model training, aggregation, and updating, each base station in the network can dynamically adapt to changes in QoS requirements brought about by user mobility. Simulations show that compared with methods based on distributed deep Q-learning, our proposed scheme effectively reduces the performance fluctuations caused by user handover and achieves lower network energy consumption while guaranteeing users' QoS requirements.

AB To further preserve the data privacy of federated learning (FL), we propose a differentially private FL (DPFL) scheme with misaligned power allocation (MPA-DPFL). Unlike most existing over-the-air FL studies, in MPA-DPFL, the gradients are aggregated through over-the-air computation (Aircomp) but do not need to be aligned in the transmission. Therefore, MPA-DPFL can avoid the problem that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the system is limited by the device with the worst channel condition. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the optimality gap of MPA-DPFL while guaranteeing a certain degree of privacy protection. Additionally, we demonstrate that the MPA-DPFL is more suitable than the DPFL with aligned power allocation (APA-DPFL) when the channel condition of a device in the system is lower than a threshold. The analytical results are validated through simulation.

AB Green tide, which is a serious water pollution problem, is caused by the complex relationships of various factors, such as flow rate, several water quality indicators, and weather. Because the existing methods are not suitable for identifying these relationships and making accurate predictions, a new system and algorithm is required to predict the green tide phenomenon and also minimize the related damage before the green tide occurs. For this purpose, we consider a new network model using smart sensor-based federated learning which is able to use distributed observation data with geologically separated local models. Moreover, we design an optimal scheduler which is beneficial to use real-time big data arrivals to make the overall network system efficient. The proposed scheduling algorithm is effective in terms of (1) data usage and (2) the performance of green tide occurrence prediction models. The advantages of the proposed algorithm is verified via data-intensive experiments with real water quality big-data.

AB Access to health data, important for population health planning, basic and clinical research and health industry utilization, remains problematic. Legislation intended to improve access to personal data across national borders has proven to be a double-edged sword, where complexity and implications from misinterpretations have paradoxically resulted in data becoming more siloed. As a result, the potential for development of health specific AI and clinical decision support tools built on real-world data have yet to be fully realized. In this perspective, we propose federated networks as a solution to enable access to diverse data sets and tackle known and emerging health problems. The perspective draws on experience from the World Economic Forum Breaking Barriers to Health Data project, the Personal Health Train and Vantage6 infrastructures, and industry insights. We first define the concept of federated networks in a healthcare context, present the value they can bring to multiple stakeholders, and discuss their establishment, operation and implementation. Challenges of federated networks in healthcare are highlighted, as well as the resulting need for and value of an independent orchestrator for their safe, sustainable and scalable implementation.

AB Federated learning (FL) offers a promising paradigm that empowers numerous Internet of Things (IoT) devices to implement distributed learning on the premise of ensuring user privacy and data security. However, since FL adopts a synchronous distributed training mode, the heterogeneity of participating IoT devices and limited communication resources make FL encounter serious issues of low training efficiency in actual deployment. In this article, we propose an excellent FL policy for the heterogeneous IoT-edge FL system to improve distributed training efficiency. Specifically, first, by borrowing the idea of clustering, we explore an iterative self-organizing data analysis techniques algorithm (ISODATA)-based heterogeneous-aware client scheduling strategy to alleviate the issue of low training efficiency incurred by the heterogeneity of clients. Subsequently, to tackle the challenge of limited communication resources in FL, we first analyze the characteristics of the optimal resource block allocation solution theoretically and then introduce a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based strategy to judiciously allocate resource blocks for scheduled clients. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that, compared with benchmarking strategies, our proposed FL policy can achieve up to 55.22% accuracy improvement in a relaxed time scenario, and attain up to 3.62 x acceleration for reaching the specific expected accuracy.

AB Federated learning uses the concept of decentralized training of n number of local clients for a small number of epochs say 2-5, and then averaging the learned weights of all local clients, and evaluating on test dataset with the average weights loaded to a global model. The train dataset is split into n clusters and each cluster acts as a distributed data for each local model. Each round of weight averaging and then uploading the average weights on each local client for further training is called communication round and it was observed that similar accuracy can be obtained with a lesser amount of training time. In this paper, instead of averaging the weights, a weighted mean concept was developed where the PSO vector helps to find the weight values for the best accuracy of a global model. It was found that PSO can help in two ways by bettering the accuracy and also reducing the training time. The proposed approach can enhance the performance of pre-trained models like AlexNet, VGG16, InceptionV3, and ResNet50 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. The maximum increase was found with VGG16 of around 26.01% for CIFAR-10 and 26.84% for CIFAR-100. Similarly, on the Tomato dataset, AlexNet accuracy can be increased by 28.56%. Multi-modal model accuracy on the fake news dataset was also enhanced by 8.21%.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel economic-efficiency framework for an electric vehicle (EV) network to maximize the profits (i.e., the amount of money that can be earned) for charging stations (CSs). To that end, we first introduce an energy demand prediction method for CSs leveraging federated learning approaches, in which each CS can train its own energy transactions locally and exchange its learned model with other CSs to improve the learning quality while protecting the CS's information privacy. Based on the predicted energy demands, each CS can reserve energy from the smart grid provider (SGP) in advance to optimize its profit. Nonetheless, due to the competition among the CSs as well as unknown information from the SGP, i.e., the willingness to transfer energy, we develop a multi-principal one-agent (MPOA) contract-based method to address these issues. In particular, we formulate the CSs' profit maximization as a non-collaborative energy contract problem under the SGP's unknown information and common constraints as well as other CSs' contracts. To solve this problem, we transform it into an equivalent low-complexity optimization problem and develop an iterative algorithm to find the optimal contracts for the CSs. Through simulation results using a real CS dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed framework can enhance energy demand prediction accuracy up to 24.63 percent compared with other machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, our proposed framework can outperform other economic models by 48 and 36 percent in terms of the CSs' utilities and social welfare (i.e., the total profits of all participating entities) of the network, respectively.

AB The fast development of mobile communication and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies greatly promotes the prosperity of the Internet of Things (IoT), where various types of IoT devices can perform more intelligent tasks. Considering the privacy leakage and limited communication resources, federated learning (FL) has emerged to enable devices to collaboratively train AI models based on their local data without raw data exchanges. Nevertheless, it is still challenging for guaranteeing any FL models to be effective due to the sluggish willingness of IoT devices and the model poisoning attacks in the FL. To address these issues, in this article, we introduce blockchain technology and propose a blockchain-based FL framework for supporting a trustworthy and reliable FL paradigm in IoT. In the proposed framework, we design a committee-based participant selection mechanism that selects the aggregate node and local model updates dynamically to construct the global model. Moreover, considering the tradeoff between the energy consumption and the convergence rate of the FL model, we perform the channel allocation, block size adjustment, and block producer selection jointly. Since the remaining resources, handling transactions, and channel conditions are dynamically varying (i.e., stochastic environment), we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and adopt a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to solve it. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show the superior performance of the DRL-based resource allocation algorithm compared with other baseline methods in terms of energy consumption.

AB Objectives: Federated learning (FL) has gained popularity in clinical research in recent years to facilitate privacy-preserving collaboration. Structured data, one of the most prevalent forms of clinical data, has experienced significant growth in volume concurrently, notably with the widespread adoption of electronic health records in clinical practice. This review examines FL applications on structured medical data, identifies contemporary limitations, and discusses potential innovations.
   Materials and methods: We searched 5 databases, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and CINAHL, to identify articles that applied FL to structured medical data and reported results following the PRISMA guidelines. Each selected publication was evaluated from 3 primary perspectives, including data quality, modeling strategies, and FL frameworks.
   Results: Out of the 1193 papers screened, 34 met the inclusion criteria, with each article consisting of one or more studies that used FL to handle structured clinical/medical data. Of these, 24 utilized data acquired from electronic health records, with clinical predictions and association studies being the most common clinical research tasks that FL was applied to. Only one article exclusively explored the vertical FL setting, while the remaining 33 explored the horizontal FL setting, with only 14 discussing comparisons between single-site (local) and FL (global) analysis.
   Conclusions: The existing FL applications on structured medical data lack sufficient evaluations of clinically meaningful benefits, particularly when compared to single-site analyses. Therefore, it is crucial for future FL applications to prioritize clinical motivations and develop designs and methodologies that can effectively support and aid clinical practice and research.

AB Federated learning (FL) has been employed for numerous privacy-sensitive applications, where distributed devices collaboratively train a global model. In industrial Internet of things (IIoT) systems, training latency is the key performance metric as the automated manufacture usually requires timely processing. The existing works increase the number of effective devices to accelerate the training. However, devices in IIoT systems are usually deployed densely; increasing the number of clients can potentially cause serious interference and prolonged training latency. In this article, we propose a resource allocation scheme for FL, namely RaFed. We formulate the problem of reducing training latency as an optimization problem, which is proved to be NP-hard. We propose a heuristic algorithm to select appropriate devices for achieving a good tradeoff between the interference and convergence time. We conduct experiments using an RGB-D dataset in an IIoT system. The results show that RaFed significantly reduces the latency by 29.9%, compared to the state-of-the-art works.

AB In the Internet of medical things, data from a single source can be easily analyzed. Besides, it is paramount to collect data from multiple sources to provide consistent, accurate, and vital information as compared to that collected from a single source. Data fusion enables the combination of data from multiple sensors. However, privacy concerns need to be addressed during data aggregation. Furthermore, since medical data is becoming increasingly sophisticated via multimodal means, there is a high likelihood that a complex relationship among biological processes exists. This challenge motivates the study. This study is proposing a secure federated learning system based on data fusion using multi -party computation and additive secret -sharing method. The gradient parameters of the federated training model are protected rather than the actual data. The purpose of protecting the gradient parameters is to address the tradeoff between prediction accuracy and data privacy. In the proposed model, a convolutional neural network, which has an efficient weight -sharing approach, is employed for the prediction. The weight of the model is encrypted using a multi -computation and additive secret sharing. Extensive simulations are carried out to ascertain the efficiency of the proposed model. Besides, the proposed system model is compared with existing works in the literature in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and f1 -score. Simulation results show that the proposed model has 97% accuracy as compared to 93% for random forest, 91% for Naive Bayes, 92% for logistic regression and 95% for decision tree. Furthermore, F1 -score of the proposed model is 89% as compared to 85% for random forest, 80% for Naive Bayes, 82% for logistic regression and 79% for decision tree. Security analysis of the proposed system model is performed, which shows that the system is robust against weighted majority vote attack, honest -but -curious party and other security related attacks.

AB Blockchain technology has been extensively studied to enable distributed and tamper-proof data processing in federated learning (FL). Most existing blockchain assisted FL (BFL) frameworks have employed a third-party blockchain network to decentralize the model aggregation process. However, decentralized model aggregation is vulnerable to pooling and collusion attacks from the third-party blockchain network. Driven by this issue, we propose a novel BFL framework that features the integration of training and mining at the client side. To optimize the learning performance of FL, we propose to maximize the long-term time average (LTA) training data size under a constraint of LTA energy consumption. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem of training client selection and resource allocation (i.e., the transmit power and computation frequency at the client side), and solve the long-term mixed integer non-linear program based on a Lyapunov technique. In particular, the proposed dynamic resource allocation and client scheduling (DRACS) algorithm can achieve a trade-off of [ $\mathcal {O}(1/V)$ , $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt {V})$ ] to balance the maximization of the LTA training data size and the minimization of the LTA energy consumption with a control parameter $V$ . Our experimental results show that the proposed DRACS algorithm achieves better learning accuracy than benchmark client scheduling strategies with limited time or energy consumption.

ID CONSTELLATION
AB The scheduling of the laser inter-satellite links (LISLs) can effectively decrease the energy consumption by deactivating idle LISLs and reduce the network latency by decreasing the average hop count through establishing appropriate dynamic LISLs, but is challenging in mega-constellations due to a large amount of satellites involved. In this paper, a federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) method for LISL scheduling is proposed, where the global scheduling is decomposed into independent decisions for each satellite. To reduce the substantial communication overhead attributable to MADRL, asynchronous hierarchical federated learning with partial and global aggregations is utilized, transmitting the model parameters rather than status information among low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellites. The movement of LEO satellites maintains the consistency of local sample distribution and the indirect association among different GEO satellites. Therefore, the global aggregation with infrequent occurrence is asynchronous with the partial aggregation. Moreover, during the partial aggregation, the utility of each layer in the local model of the LEO satellite is also evaluated to minimize the uncertainty, allowing the adaptive upload to ensure efficiency and fairness within a limited power budget. The simulation results show that the proposed method reduces the average hop by about two hops and decreases the LISLs number by over 25%. Meanwhile, the communication overhead of LEO satellites is 46.6% of that in the centralized approach, with the training performance ensured.

TI FedMCC: Federated multi-center clustering algorithm to improve privacy

AB In recent years, healthcare data from various sources such as clinical institutions, patients, and pharmaceutical industries have become increasingly abundant. However, due to the complex healthcare system and data privacy concerns, aggregating and utilizing these data in a centralized manner can be challenging. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for distributed training in edge computing scenarios, utilizing on-device user data while reducing server costs. In traditional FL, a central server trains a global model sampled client data randomly, and the server combines the collected model from different clients into one global model. However, for not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) datasets, randomly selecting users to train server is not an optimal choice and can lead to poor model training performance. To address this limitation, we propose the Federated Multi-Center Clustering algorithm (FedMCC) to enhance the robustness and accuracy for all cli-ents. FedMCC leverages the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm, focusing on training a robust base model during the initial training phase and better capturing features from different users. Subsequently, clus-tering methods are used to ensure that features among users within each cluster are similar, approximating an i.i. d. training process in each round, resulting in more effective training of the global model. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of FedMCC through extensive experiments on public healthcare datasets. The results demonstrate that FedMCC achieves improved performance and accuracy for all clients while maintaining data privacy and security, showcasing its potential for various healthcare applications.

ID PLACEMENT
AB Growing and diverse user needs, along with the need for continuous access with minimal delay in densely populated machine-type networks, have led to a significant overhaul of modern mobile communication systems. Within this realm, the integration of advanced physical layer techniques such as relaying-assisted transmission in beyond fifth-generation (B5G) networks aims to not only enhance network performance but also extend coverage across multicellular orientations. However, in cellular environments, the increased interference levels and the complex channel representations introduce a notable rise in the computational complexity associated with radio resource management (RRM) tasks. Machine and deep learning (ML/DL) have been proposed as an efficient way to support the enhanced user demands in densely populated environments since ML/DL models can relax the traffic load that is associated with RRM tasks. There is, however, in these solutions the need for distributed execution of training tasks to accelerate the decision-making process in RRM tasks. For this purpose, federated learning (FL) schemes are considered a promising field of research for next-generation (NG) networks' RRM. This paper proposes an FL approach to tackle the joint relay node (RN) selection and resource allocation problem subject to power management constraints when in B5G networks. The optimization objective of this approach is to jointly elevate energy (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) levels. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated for various relaying-assisted transmission topologies and through comparison with other state-of-the-art ones (both ML and non-ML). In particular, the total system energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) can be improved by up to approximately 10-20% compared to a state-of-the-art centralized ML scheme. Moreover, achieved accuracy can be improved by up to 10% compared to state-of-the-art non-ML solutions, while training time is reduced by approximately 50%.

AB As a fast-growing and promising technology, Internet of Things (IoT) significantly promotes the informationization and intelligentization of Maritime Transportation System (MTS). The massive data collected during the voyage is usually disposed of with the assistance of cloud or edge computing, which imposes serious cyber security threats. For multifarious cyber-attacks, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the efficient mechanisms to prevent IoT devices from network intrusion. However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of IoT-based MTS and propose a CNN-MLP based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named FedBatch. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage. Then, the lightweight local model constructed by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) is designed to save on computing and storage overhead. Moreover, to mitigate the straggler problem during the federated learning in MTS, we proposed an adaptive aggregation method, named Batch Federated Aggregation, which suppresses the oscillations of model parameters during federated learning. Finally, the simulation results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FedBatch.

AB Blockchain technology combined with Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution for enhancing privacy, security, and efficiency in medical IoT applications across edge, fog, and cloud computing environments. This approach enables multiple medical IoT devices at the network edge to collaboratively train a global machine learning model without sharing raw data, addressing privacy concerns associated with centralized data storage. This paper presents a blockchain and FL-based Smart Decision Making framework for ECG data in microservice-based IoT medical applications. Leveraging edge/fog computing for real-time critical applications, the framework implements a FL model across edge, fog, and cloud layers. Evaluation criteria including energy consumption, latency, execution time, cost, and network usage show that edge-based deployment outperforms fog and cloud, with significant advantages in energy consumption (0.1% vs. Fog, 0.9% vs. Cloud), network usage (1.1% vs. Fog, 31% vs. Cloud), cost (3% vs. Fog, 20% vs. Cloud), execution time (16% vs. Fog, 28% vs. Cloud), and latency (1% vs. Fog, 79% vs. Cloud).

AB Graph-structured data applications promote the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) in recent years. Due to privacy concerns, collecting graph data stored in massive client devices for centralized graph learning is prohibitive. It is natural to integrate federated learning (FL) in graph learning to address this issue, which enables clients to collaborate on training a shared model without uploading their data. This generates an emerging paradigm of federated graph learning (FGL). However, due to various costs incurred by FGL training, the collaboration between the server and clients is still a challenging issue in FGL, which remains largely unexplored in existing studies. To bridge this gap, we propose a cost-efficient collaboration framework for FGL of graph convolutional networks on semi-supervised node classification tasks, i.e., Joint Client and Cross-Client Edge Selection (JC(3)ES) for the server. Specifically, we first characterize how varies graph structure affect the final convergence performance of the FGL model. We then reveal the fundamental supermodular property in client selection. Based on this, we further devise an approximately optimal algorithm for the server and theoretically derive the performance gap between the proposed algorithm and the optimal solution. Extensive numerical evaluations show that our proposed algorithm achieves outstanding performance in cost-efficient collaboration for FGL on popular graph datasets.

AB As a significant paradigm change in reinforcement learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged to address the efficiency bottlenecks and privacy concerns of centralized training. However, the discrepancy of multi-energy demands among energy hubs (EHs) may cause undesirable instability of FL mechanisms. This study proposes a scheduling algorithm for adaptively controlling multiple EHs with combined heat and power, gas boiler, and electrical boiler. We first present the formulations of twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) to schedule the energy conversion under the time-varying price and demands of electricity, heat, and natural gas. The novelty of the proposed algorithm lies in developing a distributed TD3-agents training that consists of FL and matching-based agent-to-agent learning, namely matching learning (ML). Specifically, the FL is first introduced for collaborative training of EH's TD3 agents by sharing their semi-trained scheduling models. The ML innovatively proposed for addressing the training instability of FL is formulated as a matching game in which the poor-trained agents learn the scheduling knowledge from the agent who has analogous demand patterns and better reward. Simulation results display the advantage and feasibility of the proposed algorithm in terms of the speed of training convergence, energy consumption of equipment, and economic benefit.

AB This article investigates the analog gradient aggregation (AGA) solution to overcome the communication bottleneck for wireless federated learning applications by exploiting the idea of analog over-the-air transmission. Despite the various advantages, this special transmission solution also brings new challenges to both transceiver design and learning algorithm design due to the nonstationary local gradients and the time-varying wireless channels in different communication rounds. To address these issues, we propose a novel design of both the transceiver and learning algorithm for the AGA solution. In particular, the parameters in the transceiver are optimized with the consideration of the nonstationarity in the local gradients based on a simple feedback variable. Moreover, a novel learning rate design is proposed for the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which is adaptive to the quality of the gradient estimation. Theoretical analyses are provided on the convergence rate of the proposed AGA solution. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed solution is confirmed by two separate experiments based on linear regression and the shallow neural network. The simulation results verify that the proposed solution outperforms various state-of-the-art baseline schemes with a much faster convergence speed.

AB The Maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) consists of offshore equipment such as ships, consoles, and base stations, which are used for maritime information sharing to assist driving decision-making. However, with the increase in the number of MIoT access devices, the risks of information security and data reliability have also significantly increased. In this paper, we describe a maritime Dynamic Ship Federated Information Security Sharing Model (DSF-ISS) in Maritime Internet of Vessels (MIoV) based on maritime 5G broadcasting technology. The main object of this study is to solve the problem of maritime information isolated island under the condition of low communication between maritime ship nodes. In this model, maritime ship nodes cooperation is based on the Contract Network Protocol (CNP), which considers task types, spatial, and temporal distribution of different vessels. We then propose an improved federated learning approach for local dynamic nodes based on maritime 5G broadcasting technology. Moreover, this study designs a proof of membership (PoM) to share local task model information in global blockchain. The results showed that DSF-ISS has a positive effect in maritime transportation work. It effectively realizes the secure sharing of information and protects the privacy of node data.

AB Most existing wireless federated learning (FL) studies focused on homogeneous model settings where devices train identical local models. In this setting, the devices with poor communication and computation capabilities may delay the global model update and degrade the performance of FL. Moreover, in the homogenous model settings, the scale of the global model is restricted by the device with the lowest capability. To tackle these challenges, this work proposes an adaptive model pruning-based FL (AMP-FL) framework, where the edge server dynamically generates sub-models by pruning the global model for devices' local training to adapt their heterogeneous computation capabilities and time-varying channel conditions. Since the involvement of diverse structures of devices' sub-models in the global model updating may negatively affect the training convergence, we propose compensating for the gradients of pruned model regions by devices' historical gradients. We then introduce an age of information (AoI) metric to characterize the staleness of local gradients and theoretically analyze the convergence behaviour of AMP-FL. The convergence bound suggests scheduling devices with large AoI of gradients and pruning the model regions with small AoI for devices to improve the learning performance. Inspired by this, we define a new objective function, i.e., the average AoI of local gradients, to transform the inexplicit global loss minimization problem into a tractable one for device scheduling, model pruning, and resource block (RB) allocation design. Through detailed analysis, we derive the optimal model pruning strategy and transform the RB allocation problem into equivalent linear programming that can be effectively solved. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approaches. The proposed AMP-FL is capable of achieving 1.9x and 1.6x speed up for FL on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets in comparison with the FL schemes with homogeneous model settings.

AB Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key technique for distributed machine learning (ML). Most literature on FL has focused on ML model training for (i) a single task/model, with (ii) a synchronous scheme for updating model parameters, and (iii) a static data distribution setting across devices, which is often not realistic in practical wireless environments. To address this, we develop DMA-FL considering dynamic FL with multiple downstream tasks/models over an asynchronous model update architecture. We first characterize convergence via introducing scheduling tensors and rectangular functions to capture the impact of system parameters on learning performance. Our analysis sheds light on the joint impact of device training variables (e.g., number of local gradient descent steps), asynchronous scheduling decisions (i.e., when a device trains a task), and dynamic data drifts on the performance of ML training for different tasks. Leveraging these results, we formulate an optimization for jointly configuring resource allocation and device scheduling to strike an efficient trade-off between energy consumption and ML performance. Our solver for the resulting non-convex mixed integer program employs constraint relaxations and successive convex approximations with convergence guarantees. Through numerical experiments, we reveal that DMA-FL substantially improves the performance-efficiency tradeoff.

AB Fault prediction is an important application in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to ensure the safety of industrial systems and factories. Currently, deep-learning-based fault prediction models are more popular, and multifactory co-operation is required to improve the accuracy and generality of fault prediction models. Federated learning can coordinate multiple clients to train models together while protecting client privacy, and thus is widely used for training fault prediction models. How to incentivise more factories to participate in model training is crucial, however, most of the existing incentive mechanisms focus on the problem of fair measurement of client contributions and ignore the problem of incentive allocation in scenarios with limited incentive budgets. In this article, we design a self-safeguarding incentive mechanism for large-scale federated industrial maintenance based on double-layer reinforcement learning, known as dual-layer incentive (DLI). The method enables the central server to achieve higher model training accuracy within a limited incentive budget through rational allocation of incentives, which ultimately reduces the overall cost of model training. In addition, we categorize participating clients into "diligent clients," "inefficient clients," and "malicious clients" based on their contributions and design tailor-made incentives for each client type, which saves training costs and enhances the safety of the model training process. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated through experiments using various data sets. The results show that the method significantly improves the accuracy and safety of industrial fault prediction model compared to other existing methods.

AB Federated learning (FL) has been considered as a promising paradigm for enabling distributed machine learning (ML) in wireless networks. To address the limited energy capacity of wireless devices, we propose a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) aided FL, in which one FL server (FLS) co-located at a cellular base station (BS) uses SWIPT to simultaneously broadcast the global model to wireless user-devices (UDs) and provide wireless power transfer to them. The UDs then use the harvested energy to train their local models and further transmit the local models to the FLS for aggregation. To improve the spectrum efficiency, we consider that the UDs form a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) group for simultaneously sending their local models over the same spectrum channel. Taking the UDs' time-varying available energy and channel conditions into account, we propose a dynamic optimization of the UDs-scheduling, the BS's transmit-power allocation, and the UDs' power-splitting factors for SWIPT, with the objective of minimizing the long-term energy consumption while ensuring the FL convergence. The optimization problem, however, is challenging to solve since it is a finite-horizon dynamic programming problem but with an unknown stopping time, and moreover, the action space covers both discrete and continuous variables. To address these difficulties, we first execute a series of equivalent transformations to reduce the number of decision variables and then formulate the problem as a stochastic shortest path problem, based on which we propose an actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm with the proximal policy optimization to efficiently learn the policy that dynamically adjusts the UDs-scheduling for FL as well as the BS's transmit-power for SWIPT. Numerical results validate the effectiveness and performance of our proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the long-term energy consumption in comparison with two baseline algorithms.

AB Identifying individuals with similar behaviors and mobility patterns has become essential to improving the functioning of urban services. However, since these patterns can vary over time, such identification needs to be done periodically. Furthermore, once mobility data expresses the routine of individuals, privacy must be guaranteed. In this work, we propose a framework for periodically detecting and grouping individuals with behavioral similarities into communities. To accomplish this, we built an autoencoder model to extract spatio-temporal mobility features from raw user data at periodic intervals. We used Federated Learning (FL) as a training approach to preserve privacy and alleviate time-consuming training and communication costs. To determine the number of communities without risking an arbitrary number, we compared the choices of two probabilistic methods, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Since the communities are updated periodically, we also analyzed the impact of aged samples on the proposed framework. Finally, we compared the performance of our FL-based solution to a centralized training approach. We analyzed similarity and dissimilarity metrics on mobility samples and the contact time of individuals in three different scenarios. Our results indicate that AIC outperforms BIC when choosing the number of communities, although both satisfy the evaluation metrics. We also found that using older samples benefits more complex spatio-temporal scenarios. Finally, no significant losses were detected when compared to a centralized training approach, reinforcing the advantages of using the FL-based method.

AB Despite the advantages of fog-assisted internet of drones (IoD) networks for federated learning (FL) model aggregations, it is restricted by the limited battery capacity of drones and wireless channel conditions between a fog and drones. In this paper, we address the deployment problem of decentralized FL and the secrecy rate maximization problem in fog-assisted IoD networks. In particular, we leverage the overlapped zones of drones to spread their local aggregated models to the network. As such, the global model aggregation is achieved without any participation from the fog. Then, aiming to secure the proposed decentralized FL-based framework, we consider the secrecy rate maximization problem, which can be addressed by scheduling users to drones and their available radio resource blocks (RRBs). This coordinated scheduling problem of users-drones/RRBs is NP-hard. To efficiently solve it using graph theory techniques, we construct a centralized conflict clustering graph and reformulate the considered scheduling problem as a maximum-weight independent set (MWIS) problem in the constructed conflict graph. To alleviate the need for the coordinated scheduling policy at the fog, we propose to solve the coordinated scheduling problem in a distributed manner. We conduct extensive simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes over existing schemes. Selected numerical results show that the proposed distributed scheduling schemes provide similar performances in terms of secrecy rate and energy consumption as compared with the centralized scheme, with reasonable amount of information exchanges among the drones.

AB Federated learning (FL) serves as an enabling technology for intelligent edge computing, where high-quality machine learning (ML) models are collaboratively trained over large amounts of data generated by various Internet of Things devices while preserving data privacy. To further provide data confidentiality, computation auditability, and participant incentives, the blockchain framework has been incorporated into FL. However, it is an open question whether the model updates from participants in blockchain-assisted FL can disclose properties of the private data the participants are unintended to share. In this article, we propose a novel property inference attack that exploits the unintended property leakage in blockchain-assisted FL for intelligent edge computing. More specifically, we present an active attack to learn the property leakage from model updates of participants and to identify a set of participants with a certain property. We also design a dynamic participant selection strategy tailored to the setting of large-scale FL, which accelerates the selection process of target participants and improves attack accuracy. We evaluate the proposed attack through extensive experiments with publicly available data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed attack is effective and efficient in inferring various properties of training data, while maintaining the high quality of the main tasks in FL.

AB As a promising framework for distributed machine learning (ML), wireless federated learning (FL) faces the threat of eavesdropping attacks when a trained ML model is sent over a radio channel. To address this threat, we propose channel-sharing-based artificial jamming to increase the secrecy throughput of FL clients (FCs). Specifically, when an FC performs local model training, a selected device such as a sensor node (SN) not involved in the FL opportunistically accesses the FC's channel to transmit its sensing data. In return, when the FC sends its locally trained model to the FL server (FLS), the selected SN provides artificial jamming to increase the FC's secrecy throughput. Considering multiple FCs and SNs, we first consider a given pairing of FCs and SNs and optimize the local training time, the model uploading time, and the transmit-power of the FCs to minimize the total latency of FL training. After proving the convexity of this optimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm to derive the semi-analytical solution. Then, we further investigate the pairing of the FCs and the SNs to minimize a system-wise cost reflecting both energy consumption and latency. The resulting problem is a bicriteria pairing problem, and we propose an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal pairing solution. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency and performance advantage of our proposed channel-sharing-based approach with artificial jamming in comparison with different benchmark schemes.

AB Accurate estimation of residential solar photovoltaic (PV) generation is crucial for the power distribution and demand response program implementation. Currently, most distributed PVs are installed behind-the-meters (BTMs), and are thus invisible to the utilities. The existing methods separate the BTM solar generation from the available net load in a centralized manner assuming that all data are accessible to utilities. However, this can cause privacy issues, since the data are owned by different utilities and they may be unwilling to share their data. To this end, a novel method is proposed for disaggregating community-level BTM solar generation using a federated learning-based Bayesian neural network (FL-BNN), which can preserve the privacy of utilities. Specifically, a Bayesian neural network (BNN) is designed as the probabilistic energy disaggregation model with the ability to capture uncertainties. The BNN training process is extended into a decentralized manner based on the federated learning framework. To enable the model customized for each community, the layers of BNN are categorized into shallow and deep layers, and a layerwise parameter aggregation strategy is proposed to update the model. Both community-specific features and community-invariant features can be learned. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on a publicly available dataset.

AB In the foreseeable Intelligent Transportation System, Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) will play an important role in improving travel efficiency and safety. However, it is challenging for ICVs to support the resource-hungry autonomous driving applications due to the limitation of hardware computing power. Fortunately, the emergence of Multi-access Edge Computing helps overcome this limitation effectively. This paper addresses the vehicle-to-edge server computation offloading conundrum by optimizing the trade-offs in partial offloading and resource allocation. Proposing a distributed approach, this study confronts the multi-variable non-convex challenge directly by decoupling variables and deriving constraint-based bounds that guide the decisions for offloading and allocation. A novel low-complexity distributed algorithm is introduced that not only tends toward optimal but also demonstrates superior real-time applicability and efficiency, illustrated through enhanced performances both in simulated trials and genuine vehicular edge computing settings. The algorithm's practical effectiveness addresses a notable gap between the theoretical models for computation offloading and actual real-life execution, reinforcing the soundness and relevance of the proposed method. Furthermore, its advanced integration with federated learning frameworks marks a leading-edge application, substantiating significant enhancements in computational efficiency and robustness.

AB In digital recognition of substation drawings, a significant challenge is how to accurately detect complex graphic elements in each drawing. Existing detection schemes often operate in isolation, with data dispersed across multiple sources, which impedes the development of high-accuracy models. A straightforward solution of consolidating drawings from different substations for training does not satisfy the stringent security requirements of substations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel graphic element detection framework based on federated learning for multi-source substation drawings. Our framework involves a server provider, multiple power companies, and distributed substations, and it employs a universal model generation scheme that protects data privacy. Local substations utilize the designed universal graphic element extraction scheme to categorize drawings and extract smaller elements, achieving enhanced accuracy. Subsequently, we design a privacy-enhanced diffusion model for substations to protect elements before uploading them. Power companies then train local model and apply a designed dimension-compressed local differential privacy scheme to the model parameters to protect the training process. To deter server provider from maliciously exploiting model, a game theory-based optimization solution is designed between server provider and power companies. Finally, experiments conducted using substation drawings provided by multiple cooperating units demonstrate that our framework can accurately perform drawing classification and graphic element extraction, and while obtaining the strongest privacy guarantees and low time cost, it achieves an intelligent system for graphic element detection with an accuracy of 88.14% across different regional substations.

AB Due to the high propagation path loss in the millimeter wave (mm-wave) system, it is necessary to use the large antenna array for obtaining the high beamforming gain in mm-wave systems. In order to reduce the cost and complexity of hardware, an architecture called hybrid precoding is proposed, which divides the precoding operation into the analog domain and the digital domain. However, this poses a challenge for channel estimation in mm-wave systems. In addition, due to the great amount of users and antennas, the feedback overhead of channel estimation is also an issue that needs to be considered. In the letter, we consider the mm-wave massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system and propose a federated learning (FL)-base channel state information (CSI) estimation and feedback (FCEF) scheme, where each user trains the local model through the local dataset and exchanges the model parameters with the base station (BS). Thanks to upload model parameters rather than huge channel data, the FCEF scheme has lower transmission overhead than centralized learning (CL). The architecture of the proposed FCEF model is described in the letter, which consists of a CSI estimation and compression (CEC) network and a CSI recovery (CR) network. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FCEF scheme has good performance for CSI estimation and feedback in mm-wave MIMO systems, which is close to that of the CL-based scheme while ensuring lower transmission overhead.

AB Positioning is an essential service for various applications and is expected to be integrated with existing communication infrastructures in 5G and 6G. Though current Wi-Fi and cellular base stations (BSs) can be used to support this integration, the resulting precision is unsatisfactory due to the lack of precise control of the wireless signals. Recently, BSs adopting reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) have been advocated for positioning as RHSs' large number of antenna elements enable generation of arbitrary and highly-focused signal beam patterns. However, existing designs face two major challenges: i) RHSs only have limited operating bandwidth, and ii) the positioning methods cannot adapt to the diverse environments encountered in practice. To overcome these challenges, we present HoloFed, a system providing high-precision environment-adaptive user positioning services by exploiting multi-band (MB)-RHS and federated learning (FL). For improving the positioning performance, a lower bound on the error variance is obtained and utilized for guiding MB-RHS's digital and analog beamforming design. For better adaptability while preserving privacy, an FL framework is proposed for users to collaboratively train a position estimator, where we exploit the transfer learning technique to handle the lack of position labels of the users. Moreover, a scheduling algorithm for the BS to select which users train the position estimator is designed, jointly considering the convergence and efficiency of FL. Our performance evaluation based on simulations confirms that HoloFed achieves a 57% lower positioning error variance compared to a beam-scanning baseline and can effectively adapt to diverse environments.

AB Our daily lives are significantly impacted by intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) application, services, IoT gadgets, and more intelligent industries. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is anticipated to have a substantial impact on training machine learning algorithms on IoT devices without sharing data. As data privacy has become a serious societal concern, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a hot research area for enabling the collaborative training of machine learning models across many smart IoT devices while adhering to privacy constraints. Although, FL is utilized for preserving privacy in IoT networks, but it is also facing some challenges such as privacy, effectiveness, and efficiency. In this article, a taxonomy of FL-based IoT systems is proposed and an analysis of related works on FL-based IoT systems is presented. Further, a comprehensive study of various types of threats, attacks, and frameworks is done. In addition to this, a taxonomy of privacy-preserving FL techniques for IoT networks is also devised. Finally, the study is concluded by highlighting the various open research challenges in FL-based IoT networks.

AB Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) paradigm enabling multiple parties to train a model collaboratively without sharing their data. With the upcoming Sixth Generation (6 G) era, FL is expected to adopt a more prevalent role as a potential solution to overcome the challenges of data privacy, security and scalability in distributed and heterogeneous systems. Presently, research works in the security domain of FL in 6 G communication are widely pursued. However, the outcome of research efforts is critically dependent upon the concepts and platforms used during analysis and evaluation. Therefore, after an overview of FL in 6 G networks, this study highlights the requirements of analysis for the security of FL in distributed and heterogeneously involved multiple entities in 6 G networks. This study comprehensively identifies and reviews the potential Conceptual Techniques and Software Platforms for analysis and evaluation in security-related areas of FL in 6 G communication. Further, this study highlights major challenges faced during the analysis of the security of FL in 6G. Finally, this review deliberates upon the potential open research issues that can be pursued using the identified techniques and platforms.

AB Obesity is considered by many as a lifestyle choice rather than a chronic progressive disease. The Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) SOPHIA (Stratification of Obesity Phenotypes to Optimize Future Obesity Therapy) project is part of a momentum shift aiming to provide better tools for the stratification of people with obesity according to disease risk and treatment response. One of the challenges to achieving these goals is that many clinical cohorts are siloed, limiting the potential of combined data for biomarker discovery. In SOPHIA, we have addressed this challenge by setting up a federated database building on open-source DataSHIELD technology. The database currently federates 16 cohorts that are accessible via a central gateway. The database is multi-modal, including research studies, clinical trials, and routine health data, and is accessed using the R statistical programming environment where statistical and machine learning analyses can be performed at a distance without any disclosure of patient-level data. We demonstrate the use of the database by providing a proof-of-concept analysis, performing a federated linear model of BMI and systolic blood pressure, pooling all data from 16 studies virtually without any analyst seeing individual patient-level data. This analysis provided similar point estimates compared to a meta-analysis of the 16 individual studies. Our approach provides a benchmark for reproducible, safe federated analyses across multiple study types provided by multiple stakeholders.

AB Conventional unsupervised multi source domain adaptation (UMDA) methods are based on the assumption that all source domain data are accessible directly. Aiming at the problem that current UMDA methods cannot directly obtain source domain data in federated learning (FL), a knowledge distillation-based multisource domain adaptation method adapted to FL is proposed. First of all, considering that knowledge distillation allows learning solely through model access, this article adopts an improved voting mechanism by applying a smoothing technique to the confidence distribution in the source domain models. This reduces the influence of models with extreme high confidence, thereby extracting high-quality consensus knowledge. Second, this article designs a teacher model adaptive weighting strategy. It identifies irrelevant domains and malicious domains according to the similarity between consensus knowledge and the output of the teacher model. Then, it improves the robustness of the model for negative transfer. Finally, this article introduces the idea of contrastive learning. It can control the drift of a single source domain and bridge the deviation between the representation learned by the local model and the global model. Experiments show that the method proposed in this article is superior to the mainstream UMDA methods. Moreover, it is robust to negative transfer, which is suitable for many practical FL applications.

AB While a practical wireless network has many tiers where end users do not directly communicate with the central server, the users' devices have limited computation and battery powers, and the serving base station (BS) has a fixed bandwidth. Owing to these practical constraints and system models, this paper leverages model pruning and proposes a pruning-enabled hierarchical federated learning (PHFL) in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). We first derive an upper bound of the convergence rate that clearly demonstrates the impact of the model pruning and wireless communications between the clients and the associated BS. Then we jointly optimize the model pruning ratio, central processing unit (CPU) frequency and transmission power of the clients in order to minimize the controllable terms of the convergence bound under strict delay and energy constraints. However, since the original problem is not convex, we perform successive convex approximation (SCA) and jointly optimize the parameters for the relaxed convex problem. Through extensive simulation, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed PHFL algorithm in terms of test accuracy, wall clock time, energy consumption and bandwidth requirement.

AB For large-scale machine learning tasks, distributing data in multiple clients, and using distributed optimization algorithms with a parameter server can accelerate the training process. The federated average algorithm has been widely used for distributed optimization via training local models in parallel and aggregating local models in a server to obtain the global model. To further improve the performance of the federated average algorithm, a novel federated learning algorithm have been proposed in this article by embedding a lazy strategy in the distributed Adam-type algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, the learning rate is adjusted adaptively in local update and lazy update strategy is applied on the second-order momentum of clients to make the learning rate identical. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is provided for both convex and nonconvex loss functions. Experiments have been conducted on MNIST digit recognition data set and CIFAR-10 data set. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the communication overhead, thereby reduce the training time by 60% for CIFAR-10 data set, and the proposed algorithm achieve better performance than the federated average algorithm and its momentum version.

AB Federated Learning has attracted widespread attention in recent years because it allows massive edge nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing their private data sets. However, these edge nodes are usually heterogeneous in computational capability and statistically different in data distribution, i.e., non-independent and identically distributed (IID), leading to significant performance degradation. Although status quo asynchronous training methods can solve the heterogeneity issue, they cannot prevent the non-IID problem from reducing the convergence rate. In this article, we propose a novel paradigm that schedules the gradient with partially averaged gradients and applies the global momentum (GSGM) for asynchronous training over non-IID data sets in an edge environment. Our key idea is to apply global momentum and partial average on the biased gradients calculated on edge nodes after scheduling, to make the training process stable. Empirical results demonstrate that GSGM can well adapt to different degrees of non-IID data and bring 20% performance gains in terms of training stability for popular optimization algorithms with enhanced accuracy over Fashion-Mnist and CIFAR-10 data sets.

AB Cache-enabled device-to-device (D2D) communication is a potential approach to tackle the resource shortage problem. However, public concerns of data privacy and system security still remain, which thus arises an urgent need for a reliable caching scheme. Fortunately, federated learning (FL) with a distributed paradigm provides an effective way to privacy issue by training a high-quality global model without any raw data exchanges. Besides the privacy issue, blockchain can be further introduced into the FL framework to resist the malicious attacks occurred in D2D caching networks. In this study, we propose a double-layer blockchain-based deep reinforcement FL (BDRFL) scheme to ensure privacy-preserved and caching-efficient D2D networks. In BDRFL, a double-layer blockchain is utilized to further enhance data security. Simulation results first verify the convergence of the BDRFL-based algorithm, and then demonstrate that the download latency of the BDRFL-based caching scheme can be significantly reduced under different types of attacks when compared to some existing caching policies.

AB Cross-domain federated learning (FL), where data on local clients come from different domains, is a common case of FL. In such a cross-domain case, features extracted from the raw data of different clients deviate from each other in the feature space, leading to a so-called feature shift. This phenomenon can reduce feature discrimination and degrade the performance of the learned model. However, most existing FL methods are not specifically designed for the cross-domain setting. In this article, we propose a novel cross-domain FL method named AlignFed. In AlignFed, each client model consists of a personalized feature extractor and a shared lightweight classifier. The feature extractor maps the features to a consistent space by aligning them to identical global target points. Inspired by recent studies in contrastive learning, AlignFed regards points that are uniformly distributed on the hypersphere as global target points. It then pushes features toward global target points of their corresponding classes and away from those of other classes to improve feature discrimination. The shared classifier aggregates knowledge across clients over the consistent feature space, which can mitigate performance degradation caused by feature shift while reducing communication cost. We conduct convergence analysis and perform extensive experiments to evaluate AlignFed.

AB Cooling costs constitute more than half of the total data center energy expenditure. Thermal imbalance results in hotspot regions requiring additional cooling power. To reduce it, thermal aware job scheduling is a wellknown software solution that is subject to predicting correct server temperatures. Existing solutions have not explored intelligent solutions and rely only on logic based algorithms to allocate tasks that work on predefined rules. Few deep learning based solutions that are proposed, have not explored its alternatives and existing data modalities in data centers, resulting in inefficient models. Existing literature only proposes solutions based on unimodal tabular data. Therefore, we propose a multimodal architecture that considers different underlying data modalities in data centers to increase the model's efficiency and predict correct server temperatures. The increasing production of data and the need for storage and processing units has led to the development of distributed data centers. Existing techniques are limited to individual data centers which fail to consider the data privacy restrictions that arise while dealing with distributed scenarios. Findings from our simulations affirm our proposed scheme in terms of the objectives mentioned above. We propose a federated learning architecture that efficiently deals with distributed data centers while ensuring privacy. Our simulation results show an overall increase in the efficiency of the model in comparison to an existing intelligent solution. Furthermore, we provide comparative results that show how our model performs better and achieves lower thermal imbalance as compared to an existing scheme.

AB Networked health systems are often the victims of cyberattacks with serious consequences for patients and healthcare costs, with the Internet of Things (IoT) being an additional prime target. In future systems we can imagine that the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) will also be used for conveying patients for diagnosis and treatment in an integrated manner. Thus the medical field poses very significant and specific challenges since even for a single patient, several providers may carry out tests or offer healthcare services, and may have distinct interconnected sub-contractors for services such as ambulances and connected cars, connected devices or temporary staff providers, that have distinct confidentiality requirements on top of possible commercial competition. On the other hand, these distinct entities can be subject to similar or coordinated attacks, and could benefit from each others' cybersecurity experience to better detect and mitigate cyberattacks. Thus the present work proposes a novel Distributed Self- Supervised Federated Intrusion Detection Algorithm (DISFIDA), with Online Self-Supervised Federated Learning, that uses Dense Random Neural Networks (DRNN). In DISFIDA learning data is private, and neuronal weights are shared among Federated partners. Each partner in DISFIDA combines its synaptic weights with those it receives other partners, with a preference for those weights that have closer numerical values to its own weights which it has learned on its own. DISFIDA is tested with three open-access datasets against five benchmark methods, for two relevant IoT healthcare applications: networks of devices (e.g., body sensors), and Connected Smart Vehicles (e.g., ambulances that transport patients). These tests show that the DISFIDA approach offers 100% True Positive Rate for attacks (one percentage point better than comparable state of the art methods which attain 99%) so that it does better at detecting attacks, with 99% True Negative Rate similar to state-of-the-art Federated Learning, for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

AB The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has had a significant impact on various industries, including healthcare. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has played a vital role in this evolution. However, while AI has contributed to many benefits in healthcare, concerns about data privacy and security persist. To address these concerns, we propose a framework that combines Federated Learning (FL) and Differential Privacy (DP) to enhance data protection within IoMT. By integrating FL's decentralized approach with DP's mechanism to prevent data reconstruction from model outputs, we can improve data confidentiality. This integrated approach is used to develop and analyze high-performing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting Tuberculosis using chest X-ray datasets. The framework undergo thorough performance evaluation, utilizing various metrics to establish its superiority over baseline models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework as a robust solution for secure and private AI applications in healthcare.

AB As a distributed deep learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) provides a powerful tool for the accurate and efficient processing of on-board data in vehicular edge computing (VEC). However, FL involves the training and transmission of model parameters, which consumes the vehicles' precious energy resources and takes up much time. It is a departure from many applications with severe real-time requirements in VEC. And the capabilities and data quality of each vehicle are distinct that will affect the performance of training the model. Therefore, it is crucial to select the appropriate vehicles to participate in learning tasks and optimize resource allocation under learning time and energy consumption constraints. In this paper, taking the vehicle position and velocity into consideration, we formulate a min-max optimization problem to jointly optimize the on-board computation capability, transmission power, and local model accuracy to achieve the minimum cost in the worst case of FL. Specifically, we propose a greedy algorithm to select vehicles with higher image quality dynamically, and it keeps the system's overall cost to a minimum in FL. The formulated optimization problem is a nonlinear programming problem, so we decompose it into two subproblems. For the resource allocation problem, we use the Lagrangian dual problem and the subgradient projection method to approximate the optimal value iteratively. For the local model accuracy problem, we develop an adaptive harmony algorithm for heuristic search. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithms have well convergence and effectiveness and achieve a tradeoff between cost and fairness.

AB This paper considers the problem of learning a control policy for robot motion planning with zeroshot generalization, i.e., no data collection and policy adaptation is needed when the learned policy is deployed in new environments. We develop a federated reinforcement learning framework that enables collaborative learning of multiple learners and a central server, i.e., the Cloud, without sharing their raw data. In each iteration, each learner uploads its local control policy and the corresponding estimated normalized arrival time to the Cloud, which then computes the global optimum among the learners and broadcasts the optimal policy to the learners. Each learner then selects between its local control policy and that from the Cloud for next iteration. The proposed framework leverages on the derived zero -shot generalization guarantees on arrival time and safety. Theoretical guarantees on almost -sure convergence, almost consensus, Pareto improvement and optimality gap are also provided. Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to evaluate the proposed framework.

AB Recently, it has been shown that analog transmission based federated learning enables more efficient usage of communication resources compared to the conventional digital transmission. In this paper, we propose an effective model compression strategy enabling analog FL under constrained communication bandwidth. To this end, the proposed approach is based on pattern shared sparsification by setting the same sparsification pattern of parameter vectors uploaded by edge devices, as opposed to each edge device independently applying sparsification. In particular, we propose specific schemes for determining the sparsification pattern and characterize the convergence of analog FL leveraging these proposed sparsification strategies, by deriving a closed-form upper boun d of convergence rate and residual error. The closed-form expression allows to capture the effect of communication bandwidth and power budget to the performance of analog FL. In terms of convergence analysis, the model parameter obtained with the proposed schemes is proven to converge to the optimum of model parameter. Numerical results show that leveraging the proposed pattern shared sparsification consistently improves the performance of analog FL in various settings of system parameters. The improvement in performance is more significant under scarce communication bandwidth and limited transmit power budget.

AB Since the invention in 2016, federated learning (FL) has been a key concept of artificial intelligence, in which the data of FL users needs not to be uploaded to the central server. However, performing FL tasks may not be feasible due to the unavailability of terrestrial communications and the battery limitation of FL users. To address these issues, we make use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless powered communications (WPC) for FL networks. In order to enable sustainable FL solutions, the UAV equipped with edge computing and WPC capabilities is deployed as an aerial energy source as well as an aerial server to perform FL tasks. We propose a joint algorithm of UAV placement, power control, transmission time, model accuracy, bandwidth allocation, and computing resources, namely energy-efficient FL (E2FL), aiming at minimizing the total energy consumption of the aerial server and users. The E2FL overcomes the original nonconvex problem by an efficient algorithm. We show that sustainable FL solutions can be provided via UAV-enabled WPC through various simulation results. Moreover, the outperformance of E2FL in terms of energy efficiency over several benchmarks emphasizes the need for a joint resource allocation framework rather than optimizing a subset of optimization factors.

AB Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm for privacy-preserving machine learning, in which multiple clients collaborate to generate a global model through training individual models with local data. However, FL is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks (MPAs) as malicious clients are able to destroy the global model by modifying local models. Although numerous model poisoning defense methods are extensively studied, they remain vulnerable to newly proposed optimized MPAs and are constrained by the necessity to presume a certain proportion of malicious clients. To this end, in this paper, we propose MODEL, a model poisoning defense framework for FL through truth discovery (TD). A distinctive aspect of MODEL is its ability to effectively prevent both optimized and byzantine MPAs. Furthermore, it requires no presupposed threshold for different settings of malicious clients (e.g., less than 33% or no more than 50%). Specifically, a TD-based metric and a clustering-based filtering mechanism are proposed to evaluate local models and avoid presupposing a threshold. Furthermore, MODEL is effective for non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) training data. In addition, inspired by game theory, we incorporate a truthful and fair incentive mechanism in MODEL to encourage active client participation while mitigating the potential desire for attacks from malicious clients. Extensively comparative experiments demonstrate that MODEL effectively safeguards against optimized MPAs and outperforms the state-of-the-art.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform data analysis in many domains. Progress in each domain is driven by a growing body of annotated data, increased computational resources, and technological innovations. In medicine, the sensitivity of the data, the complexity of the tasks, the potentially high stakes, and a requirement of accountability give rise to a particular set of challenges. In this review, we focus on three key methodological approaches that address some of the particular challenges in AI-driven medical decision making. 1) Explainable AI aims to produce a human-interpretable justification for each output. Such models increase confidence if the results appear plausible and match the clinicians expectations. However, the absence of a plausible explanation does not imply an inaccurate model. Especially in highly non-linear, complex models that are tuned to maximize accuracy, such interpretable representations only reflect a small portion of the justification. 2) Domain adaptation and transfer learning enable AI models to be trained and applied across multiple domains. For example, a classification task based on images acquired on different acquisition hardware. 3) Federated learning enables learning large-scale models without exposing sensitive personal health information. Unlike centralized AI learning, where the centralized learning machine has access to the entire training data, the federated learning process iteratively updates models across multiple sites by exchanging only parameter updates, not personal health data. This narrative review covers the basic concepts, highlights relevant corner-stone and state-of-the-art research in the field, and discusses perspectives.

AB When it comes to the marriage of federated learning and personalized recommendation services (FedRec), characterizing user-item interaction behaviors is a long-standing and unresolved issue, highlighting the growing data privacy concerns due to the inherent openness of recommender systems. As the new interaction-level membership inference attacks on FedRecs have recently surfaced, quite possibly such adversarial attacks act as the hidden confounders lying behind the interactive recommendation, resulting in the obstruction of the causal effect disentanglement on long-term user satisfaction. As such, tailored to the specifics of private learning, we propose a counterfactual interactive recommendation system that builds a differentially private representation learning based defender (CIRDP) to capture and mitigate the adversarial threats, augmenting causal inference-based interactive recommendation of FedRecs. When characterizing interaction-level membership inference attacks of the hidden eavesdropping adversary as the primary cause of adversarial effect on user satisfaction, CIRDP incorporates causal inference-augmented offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) into FedRecs. CIRDP innovatively provides counterfactual satisfaction by optimizing a sensitivity-guided disentangled representation module with an innovative two-fold mutual information objective. As such, CIRDP introduces a differentially private representation learning based defender, guaranteeing interaction behavior-level differential privacy (DP) with a significant reduction in privacy costs. Extensive comparisons demonstrate CIRDP's superiority over the state-of-the-art baselines in reducing inference attack threats and improving long-term success in the interactive recommendation.

AB In a vertical federated learning (VFL) scenario where features and models are split into different parties, it has been shown that sample-level gradient information can be exploited to deduce crucial label information that should be kept secret. An immediate defense strategy is to protect sample-level messages communicated with Homomorphic Encryption (HE), exposing only batch-averaged local gradients to each party. In this paper, we show that even with HE-protected communication, private labels can still be reconstructed with high accuracy by gradient inversion attack, contrary to the common belief that batch-averaged information is safe to share under encryption. We then show that backdoor attack can also be conducted by directly replacing encrypted communicated messages without decryption. To tackle these attacks, we propose a novel defense method, Confusional AutoEncoder (termed CAE), which is based on autoencoder and entropy regularization to disguise true labels. To further defend attackers with sufficient prior label knowledge, we introduce DiscreteSGD-enhanced CAE (termed DCAE), and show that DCAE significantly boosts the main task accuracy than other known methods when defending various label inference attacks.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving learnto train shared learning models across data silos collaboHowever, the economic considerations of the clients, such as fairness and incentive, are yet to be fully explored. Without such considerations, self-motivated clients may lose interest and leave the federation. To address this problem, we designed a novel incentive mechanism that involves a client selection process to remove low-quality clients and a money transfer process to ensure a fair reward distribution. Our experimental results strongly demonstrate that the proposed incentive mechanism can effectively improve the duration and fairness of the federation.

AB Federated Learning (FL) has been drawing significant attention from both academia and industry working on distributed machine learning. In practice, learning over mutually isolated datasets residing at the network edge, also known as silos, FL clients can suffer from a lack of samples, due to many reasons (e.g., expensive annotation), and this has potentially significant negative impact on FL performance. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) has been considered as a promising solution, but unfortunately cannot be directly applied to practical Cross-Silo Federated Learning (CSFL) systems. In this article, as far as we know, we conduct the first systematic discussion of the specific challenges of FSL in CSFL systems. We extract essential design issues found in Federated Few-Shot Learning (FFSL), and develop a new FFSL method based on Model-Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML). Through experiments using real-world federated datasets, we comprehensively demonstrate our method's advantages over existing FL and FSL methods in different practical CSFL scenarios where hitherto FL and FSL methods failed. We also highlight some promising future research directions.

AB Federated learning (FL) is an emerging machinelearning framework, which enables multiple mobile users to collaboratively train a global model without uploading their local sensitive data. Due to limited network bandwidth, communication efficiency has become a significant bottleneck for the implementation of FL. Existing works attempt to improve this situation by reducing the total bits transferred for each client update via data compression. However, these research works are only from the perspective of update parameters to reduce the transmission of redundant parameters. They do not explore the intrinsic reasons for redundant parameters. In this article, we propose a coreset-based FL (CBFL) framework. Instead of training model on full datasets with a regular network model, CBFL uses a much smaller well-matched evolutionary network model on coreset. CBFL indirectly reduces the total transmission bits for each client while achieving a similar accuracy as training with full datasets. CBFL includes a novel distributed coreset construction and adaptive model evolution algorithms. The network model is adaptively adjusted during this process, which dynamically removes the least important connections from the current model. Experimental results with various datasets and models show that CBFL is able to find an optimized evolutionary model that has about 10% of the total number of connections in the original regular model while only about 2% degradation in model accuracy.

AB With the massive deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, many data analysis applications emerge for the large amount of data accumulated by IoT. Federated learning (FedL) on IoT devices is an appealing mode to train a precise data analysis model. However, existing FedL schemes either take expensive computation costs (e.g., public-key cryptographic operations) or a large number of interactions among participants. Obviously, these schemes are unsuitable for IoT devices due to the limited computational and communication resources. In this work, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving FedL scheme for IoT devices. To protect the privacy of individual local data, we add masks to intervening parameters. An effective secret-sharing scheme is adopted to ensure that masks can be eliminated accurately. Considering that FedL involves multiple iterations and mask generation for each iteration costs a large number of interactions among users for privacy guarantee, we also design a secure mask reusing mechanism for large-scale FedL tasks. We prove that our scheme is secure against the honest-but-curious model. In addition, we also expand our scheme to deal with the collusion attack. Extensive experiments on real IoT devices demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our work.

AB Space-assisted vehicular networks (SAVN) provide seamless coverage and on-demand data processing services for user vehicles (UVs). However, ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) demands imposed by emerging vehicular applications are hard to be satisfied in SAVN by existing computation offloading techniques. Traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms are unsuitable for highly dynamic SAVN due to the underutilization of environment observations. An AsynchronouS federaTed deep Q-learning (DQN)-basEd and URLLC-aware cOmputatIon offloaDing algorithm (ASTEROID) is presented in this paper to achieve throughput maximization considering the long-term URLLC constraints. Specifically, we first establish an extreme value theory-based URLLC constraint model. Second, the task offloading and computation resource allocation are decomposed by employing Lyapunov optimization. Finally, an asynchronous federated DQN-based (AF-DQN) algorithm is presented to address the UV-side task offloading problem. The server-side computation resource allocation is settled by an queue backlog-aware algorithm. Simulation results verify that ASTEROID achieves superior throughput and URLLC performances.

AB Received signal strength (RSS) fingerprintbased indoor localization has received increasing popularity over the past decades. However, it suffers from the high calibration effort for fingerprint collection. In this paper, a Centralized indooR localizatioNmethod using Pseudo-label (CRNP) is proposed, which employs a small set of labeled data (RSS fingerprint) along with large volumes of unlabeled data (RSS valueswithout coordinates) to reduce theworkload of labeled data collection and improve the indoor localization performance. However, the rich location data is large in quantity and privacy sensitive, which may lead to high network cost (i. e., data transmission cost, data storage cost) and potential privacy leakage for data transmission to the central server. Therefore, a decentralized indoor localization method incorporating CRNP and federated learning is devised, which keeps the location data on local users' devices and improves the shared CRNP model by aggregating users' updates of the model. The experiment results demonstrate that (i) the proposed CRNP enables to improve the indoor localization accuracy by using unlabeled crowdsourced data; (ii) the designed decentralized scheme is robust to different data distribution and is capable to reduce the network cost and prevent users' privacy leakage.

AB The sparse data in PM2.5 air quality monitoring systems is frequently happened on large-scale smart city sensing applications, which is collected via massive sensors. Moreover, it could be affected by inefficient node deployment, insufficient communication, and fragmented records, which is the main challenge of the high-resolution prediction system. In addition, data privacy in the existing centralized air quality prediction system cannot be ensured because the data which are mined from end sensory nodes constantly exposed to the network. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel edge computing framework, named Federated Compressed Learning (FCL), which provides efficient data generation while ensuring data privacy for PM2.5 predictions in the application of smart city sensing. The proposed scheme inherits the basic ideas of the compression technique, regional joint learning, and considers a secure data exchange. Thus, it could reduce the data quantity while preserving data privacy. This study would like to develop a green energy-based wireless sensing network system by using FCL edge computing framework. It is also one of key technologies of software and hardware co-design for reconfigurable and customized sensing devices application. Consequently, the prototypes are developed in order to validate the performances of the proposed framework. The results show that the data consumption is reduced by more than 95% with an error rate below 5%. Finally, the prediction results based on the FCL will generate slightly lower accuracy compared with centralized training. However, the data could be heavily compacted and securely transmitted in WSNs.

AB Traditional centralized machine learning uses a large amount of data for model training, which may face some privacy and security problems. On the other hand, federated learning (FL), which focuses on privacy protection, also faces challenges such as core network congestion and limited mobile device (MD) resources. The computation offloading technology of mobile edge computing (MEC) can effectively alleviate these challenges, but it ignores the effect of user mobility and the unpredictable MEC environment. In this paper, we first propose an architecture that combines digital twin (DT) and MEC technologies with the FL framework, where the DT network can virtually imitate the statue of physical entities (PEs) and network topology to be used for real-time data analysis and network resource optimization. The computation offloading technology of MEC is used to alleviate resource constraints of MDs and the core network congestion. We further leverage the FL to construct DT models based on PEs' running data. Then, we jointly optimize the problem of computation offloading and resource allocation to reduce the straggler effect in FL based on the framework. Since the solution of the objective function is a stochastic programming problem, we model a Markov decision process (MDP), and use the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to solve this objective function. The simulation results prove the feasibility of the proposed scheme, and the scheme can significantly reduce the total cost by about 50% and improve the communication performance compared with baseline schemes.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a technique that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a model without sharing raw private data, and it is ideal for smart healthcare. However, it raises new privacy concerns due to the risk of privacy-sensitive medical data leakage. It is not until recently that the privacy-preserving FL (PPFL) has been introduced as a solution to ensure the privacy of training processes. Unfortunately, most existing PPFL schemes are highly dependent on complex cryptographic mechanisms or fail to guarantee the accuracy of training models. Besides, there has been little research on the fairness of the payment procedure in the PPFL with incentive mechanisms. To address the above concerns, we first construct an efficient non-interactive designated decryptor function encryption (NDD-FE) scheme to protect the privacy of training data while maintaining high communication performance. We then propose a blockchain-based PPFL framework with fair payment for medical image detection, namely ESB-FL, by combining the NDD-FE and an elaborately designed blockchain. ESB-FL not only inherits the characteristics of the NDD-FE scheme, but it also ensures the interests of each participant. We finally conduct extensive security analysis and experiments to show that our new framework has enhanced security, good accuracy, and high efficiency.

TI Clustering Federated Learning for Bearing Fault Diagnosis in Aerospace

AB Bearings, as the key mechanical components of rotary machinery, are widely used in modern aerospace equipment, such as helicopters and aero-engines. Intelligent fault diagnosis, as the main function of prognostic health management systems, plays a critical role in maintaining equipment safety in aerospace applications. Recently, data-driven intelligent diagnosis approaches have achieved great success due to the availability of large-scale, high-quality, and complete labeled data. However, in a real application, labeled data is often scarce because it requires manual labeling, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Meanwhile, health monitoring data are usually scattered in different regions or equipment in the form of data islands. Traditional fault diagnosis techniques fail to gather enough data for model training due to data security, economic conflict, relative laws, and other reasons. Therefore, it is a challenge to effectively combine the data advantages of different equipment to develop an intelligent diagnosis model with better performance. To address this issue, a novel clustering federated learning (CFL) method with a self-attention mechanism is proposed for bearing fault diagnosis. Firstly, a deep neural network with a self-attention mechanism is developed in a convolutional pipe for feature extraction, which can capture local and global information from raw input. Then, the CFL is further constructed to gather the data from different equipment with similar data distribution in an unsupervised manner. Finally, the CFL-based diagnosis model can be well trained by fully utilizing the distributed data, while ensuring data privacy safety. Experiments are carried out with three different bearing datasets in aerospace applications. The effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method have been validated compared with other popular fault diagnosis schemes.

DT Article
AB The continuous growth of smart devices needing processing has led to moving storage and computation from cloud to the network edges, giving rise to the edge computing paradigm. Owing to the limited capacity of edge computing nodes, the presence of popular applications in the edge nodes results in significant improvements in users' satisfaction and service accomplishment. However, the high variability in the content requests makes prediction demand not trivial and, typically, the majority of the classical prediction approaches require the gathering of personal users' information at a central unit, giving rise to many users' privacy issues. In this context, federated learning gained attention as a solution to perform learning procedures from data disseminated across multiple users, keeping the sensitive data protected. This study applies federated learning to the demand prediction problem, to accurately forecast the more popular application types in the network. The proposed framework reaches high accuracy levels on the predicted applications demand, aggregating in a global and weighted model the feedback received by users, after their local training. The validity of the proposed approach is verified by performing a virtual machine replica copies and comparison with the alternative forecasting approach based on chaos theory and deep learning.

AB Managing for local data among the increasingly popular consumer smart electronics in a secure manner while increasing the user experience is still a hard work. Federated learning (FL), can develop intelligent electronics-related applications while protecting the privacy of local data. However, considering the traditional cloud-based FL training process, consumer electronics with a limited energy budget can reduce the training efficiency. Hence, in this paper, to reduce the total latency of FL training while also meeting a targeted minimum value of loss function and meeting the long-term energy consumption among smart consumer electronics, we introduce an energy-efficient hierarchical FL algorithm and formulate a multi-objective optimization problem including diversified resource allocation and device association. Considering channel state information is unavailable for all rounds, applying the Lyapunov optimization framework, an alternative problem incorporating the significance of local models is reformulated to decrease the training latency per round and enhance long-term performance at the same time. To achieve a better solution to the device association problem, a low-complexity two-operation device association algorithm is proposed, along with resource allocation for training time control, local computing power control, and bandwidth allocation. Our proposed algorithm can achieve better learning performance while meeting the energy budget compared with multiple benchmarks, according to numerical results.

AB Internet of medical things (IoMT) has made it possible to collect applications and medical devices to improve healthcare information technology. Since the advent of the pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2019, public health information has become more sensitive than ever. Moreover, different news items incorporated have resulted in differing public perceptions of COVID-19, especially on the social media platform and infrastructure. In addition, the unprecedented virality and changing nature of COVID-19 makes call centres to be likely overstressed, which is due to a lack of authentic and unregulated public media information. Furthermore, the lack of data privacy has restricted the sharing of COVID-19 information among health institutions. To resolve the above-mentioned limitations, this paper is proposing a privacy infrastructure based on federated learning and blockchain. The proposed infrastructure has the potentials to enhance the trust and authenticity of public media to disseminate COVID-19 information. Also, the proposed infrastructure can effectively provide a shared model while preserving the privacy of data owners. Furthermore, information security and privacy analyses show that the proposed infrastructure is robust against information security-related attacks.

AB Advancements in Vehicular ad-hoc Network (VANET) technology have led to a growing network of interconnected devices, including edge devices, resulting in substantial data generation. The data generated by vehicles is subsequently shared with other devices, such as Roadside Units (RSUs). However, ensuring secure data sharing poses a significant challenge due to the potential risk of data breaches. Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has garnered substantial attention in the research community, enabling data owners to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model while retaining all their training data privately. However, traditional FL-based approaches are susceptible to inference and gradient leakage attacks. This paper presents a framework for private data sharing in VANETs using FL with local differential privacy. In the first layer, vehicles apply local differential privacy techniques to their data before sharing it with the RSU. The second layer is responsible for training model parameters at the RSU and updating the trained weights with the training server. To assess our system's performance, we evaluate it based on accuracy and simulation time for both local and global parameter sharing. Additionally, we measure each client's performance by calculating accuracy measures during each iteration. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only ensures security against inference and gradient leakage attacks but also exhibits superior efficiency compared to its counterparts.

AB Nowadays, the vehicular networks have emerged as a boosting technology to enhance traffic efficiency and safety within the transportation systems. As the amount of onboard data increases and the data privacy concerns grow, federated learning (FL) has gained popularity for harnessing the data for intelligent transportation operations. To satisfy the strict latency criteria in the vehicular networks, a quantization scheme is employed within FL to reduce the size of the local models before uplink transmission. In this article, considering the nature of vehicles' high mobility, we aim to optimize both the learning performance and latency simultaneously by jointly considering the communication resource budget and quantization strategies. Specifically, we first analyse the convergence performance of the quantized FL, which demonstrates the effects of both the quantization error and the number of clients on the convergence rate. Then, we formulate a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) to maximize the number of participating clients and minimize the overall latency, by jointly optimizing the quantization level, wireless resource allocation, and client selection. To deal with the MOP, we decompose the MOP into a set of scalar optimization subproblems, each formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). To solve the MDP in high-mobile vehicular networks, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based vehicle heterogeneous quantization FL (DRL-VQFL) method, which leverages a DRL framework built upon the proximal policy optimization algorithm. Then, a parameter transfer strategy is employed to solve the neighboring subproblems efficiently. Our extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the DRL-VQFL approach, showcasing its superiority over the other benchmark methods.

AB Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm through which decentralized devices can collaboratively train a common model. However, a serious concern is the leakage of privacy from exchanged gradient information between clients and the parameter server (PS) in FL. To protect gradient information, clients can adopt differential privacy (DP) to add additional noises and distort original gradients before they are uploaded to the PS. Nevertheless, the model accuracy will be significantly impaired by DP noises, making DP impracticable in real systems. In this work, we propose a novel noise information secretly sharing (NISS) algorithm to alleviate the disturbance of DP noises by sharing negated noises among clients. We theoretically prove that: 1) if clients are trustworthy, DP noises can be perfectly offset on the PS and 2) clients can easily distort negated DP noises to protect themselves in case that other clients are not totally trustworthy, though the cost lowers model accuracy. NISS is particularly applicable for FL across multiple Internet of Things (IoT) systems, in which all IoT devices need to collaboratively train a model. To verify the effectiveness and the superiority of the NISS algorithm, we conduct experiments with the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets. The experimental results verify our analysis and demonstrate that NISS can improve model accuracy by 19% on average and obtain better privacy protection if clients are trustworthy.

AB Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a promising technology converging communication and computation over wireless networks, which can be particularly effective in model training, inference, and more emerging edge intelligence applications. AirComp relies on uncoded transmission of individual signals, which are added naturally over the multiple access channel thanks to the superposition property of the wireless medium. Despite significantly improved communication efficiency, how to accommodate AirComp in the existing and future digital communication networks, that are based on discrete modulation schemes, remains a challenge. This paper proposes a massive digital AirComp (MD-AirComp) scheme, that leverages an unsourced massive access protocol, to enhance compatibility with both current and next-generation wireless networks. MD-AirComp utilizes vector quantization to reduce the uplink communication overhead, and employs shared quantization and modulation codebooks. At the receiver, we propose a near-optimal approximate message passing-based algorithm to compute the model aggregation results from the superposed sequences, which relies on estimating the number of devices transmitting each code sequence, rather than trying to decode the messages of individual transmitters. We apply MD-AirComp to federated edge learning (FEEL), and show that it significantly accelerates FEEL convergence compared to state-of-the-art while using the same amount of communication resources.

ID SKIN-CANCER; CLASSIFICATION
AB Importance The development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based melanoma classifiers typically calls for large, centralized datasets, requiring hospitals to give away their patient data, which raises serious privacy concerns. To address this concern, decentralized federated learning has been proposed, where classifier development is distributed across hospitals. Objective To investigate whether a more privacy-preserving federated learning approach can achieve comparable diagnostic performance to a classical centralized (ie, single-model) and ensemble learning approach for AI-based melanoma diagnostics. Design, Setting, and Participants This multicentric, single-arm diagnostic study developed a federated model for melanoma-nevus classification using histopathological whole-slide images prospectively acquired at 6 German university hospitals between April 2021 and February 2023 and benchmarked it using both a holdout and an external test dataset. Data analysis was performed from February to April 2023. Exposures All whole-slide images were retrospectively analyzed by an AI-based classifier without influencing routine clinical care. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) served as the primary end point for evaluating the diagnostic performance. Secondary end points included balanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Results The study included 1025 whole-slide images of clinically melanoma-suspicious skin lesions from 923 patients, consisting of 388 histopathologically confirmed invasive melanomas and 637 nevi. The median (range) age at diagnosis was 58 (18-95) years for the training set, 57 (18-93) years for the holdout test dataset, and 61 (18-95) years for the external test dataset; the median (range) Breslow thickness was 0.70 (0.10-34.00) mm, 0.70 (0.20-14.40) mm, and 0.80 (0.30-20.00) mm, respectively. The federated approach (0.8579; 95% CI, 0.7693-0.9299) performed significantly worse than the classical centralized approach (0.9024; 95% CI, 0.8379-0.9565) in terms of AUROC on a holdout test dataset (pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank, P < .001) but performed significantly better (0.9126; 95% CI, 0.8810-0.9412) than the classical centralized approach (0.9045; 95% CI, 0.8701-0.9331) on an external test dataset (pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank, P < .001). Notably, the federated approach performed significantly worse than the ensemble approach on both the holdout (0.8867; 95% CI, 0.8103-0.9481) and external test dataset (0.9227; 95% CI, 0.8941-0.9479). Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this diagnostic study suggest that federated learning is a viable approach for the binary classification of invasive melanomas and nevi on a clinically representative distributed dataset. Federated learning can improve privacy protection in AI-based melanoma diagnostics while simultaneously promoting collaboration across institutions and countries. Moreover, it may have the potential to be extended to other image classification tasks in digital cancer histopathology and beyond.

ID APPROXIMATION
AB Emerging hardware technology enables the utilization of a large number of multitype sensors with diverse sensing capabilities for data collection and the training of AI models. Each sensor collects partial data samples on a type-specific feature space, which results in hybrid data partitioning across the local datasets and brings challenges to developing a novel communication-efficient and scalable training algorithm. We propose a hierarchical federated learning framework for such hybrid data partitioning with a multitier-partitioned neural network architecture. Specifically, we adopt a primal-dual transform to decompose the training problem on both the sample and feature space. Then, a stochastic coordinate gradient descent ascent algorithm is implemented with intratype and intertype over-the-air aggregation for the update of the primal variables and dual variables, respectively. The incorporation of over-the-air aggregation for signal transmission naturally harnesses the channel perturbations and interference for lower communication complexity and preserved privacy. Despite the influence of transmission noise and channel distortion, convergence analysis is provided for general objective functions, which illustrates the robust training performance of the proposed algorithm with a theoretical guarantee.

AB Machine learning (ML) is widely used for key tasks in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV), including perception, planning, and control. However, its reliance on vehicular data for model training presents significant challenges related to in-vehicle user privacy and communication overhead generated by massive data volumes. Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized ML approach that enables multiple vehicles to collaboratively develop models, broadening learning from various driving environments, enhancing overall performance, and simultaneously securing local vehicle data privacy and security. This survey paper presents a review of the advancements made in the application of FL for CAV (FL4CAV). First, centralized and decentralized frameworks of FL are analyzed, highlighting their key characteristics and methodologies. Second, diverse data sources, models, and data security techniques relevant to FL in CAVs are reviewed, emphasizing their significance in ensuring privacy and confidentiality. Third, specific applications of FL are explored, providing insight into the base models and datasets employed for each application. Finally, existing challenges for FL4CAV are listed and potential directions for future investigation to further enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of FL in the context of CAV are discussed.

AB The rise of security concerns in conventional centralized learning has driven the adoption of federated learning. However, the risks posed by poisoning attacks from internal adversaries against federated systems necessitate robust anti-poisoning frameworks. While previous defensive mechanisms relied on outlier detection, recent approaches focus on latent space representation. In this paper, we investigate a novel robust aggregation method for federated learning, namely Fed-LSAE, which leverages latent space representation via the penultimate layer and Autoencoder to exclude malicious clients from the training process. Specifically, Fed-LSAE measures the similarity level of each local latent space vector to the global one using the Center Kernel Alignment algorithm in every training round. The results of this algorithm are categorized into benign and attack groups, in which only the benign cluster is sent to the central server for federated averaging aggregation. In other words, adversaries would be detected and eliminated from the federated training procedure. The experimental results on the CIC-ToN-IoT and N-BaIoT datasets confirm the feasibility of our defensive mechanism against cutting- edge poisoning attacks for developing a robust federated-based threat detector in the Internet of Things (IoT) context. The evaluation of the federated approach witnesses an upward trend of approximately 98% across all metrics when integrating with our Fed-LSAE defense.

AB Recent advances in electronic devices and communication infrastructure have revolutionized the traditional healthcare system into a smart healthcare system by using internet of medical things (IoMT) devices. However, due to the centralized training approach of artificial intelligence (AI), mobile and wearable IoMT devices raise privacy issues concerning the information communicated between hospitals and end-users. The information conveyed by the IoMT devices is highly confidential and can be exposed to adversaries. In this regard, federated learning (FL), a distributive AI paradigm, has opened up new opportunities for privacy preservation in IoMT without accessing the confidential data of the participants. Further, FL provides privacy to end-users as only gradients are shared during training. For these specific properties of FL, in this paper, we present privacy-related issues in IoMT. Afterwards, we present the role of FL in IoMT networks for privacy preservation and introduce some advanced FL architectures by incorporating deep reinforcement learning (DRL), digital twin, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for detecting privacy threats. Moreover, we present some practical opportunities for FL in IoMT. In the end, we conclude this survey by discussing open research issues and challenges while using FL in future smart healthcare systems.

   Incentive mechanism; Serverless data pipelines; Dynamic scaling
AB With the rapid increase in the number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, the massive volume of data creates significant challenges for traditional cloud-based solutions. These solutions often lead to high latency, increased operational costs, and limited scalability, making them unsuitable for real-time applications and resource- constrained environments. Asa result, edge, and fog computing have emerged as viable alternatives, reducing latency and costs by processing data closer to its source. However, managing the flow of such vast and distributed data streams requires well-structured data pipelines to control the complete lifecycle-from data acquisition at the source to processing at the edge and fog layers, and finally storage and analytics in the cloud. To dynamically handle data analytics at varying distances from the source, often on heterogeneous hardware devices with collaborative learning techniques such as Federated Learning (FL). FL enables decentralized model training by leveraging the local data on Edge Devices (EDs), thereby preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead with the cloud. However, FL faces critical challenges, including data heterogeneity, where the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of data degrades model performance, and resource limitations on EDs, which lead to inefficiencies in training and biases in the aggregated models. To address these issues, we propose a novel FL solution, called Pop-Up Federated Learning (PopFL) in edge networks. This solution introduces hierarchical aggregation to reduce network congestion by distributing the aggregation tasks across multiple Fog Servers (FSs), rather than relying solely on centralized cloud aggregation. To further enhance participation and resource utilization at the edge, we incorporate the Stackelberg game model, which incentivizes EDs based on their contribution and resource availability. Additionally, PopFL employs a pop-up ad-hoc network for scalable and efficient communication between EDs and FSs, ensuring robust data transmission in dynamic network conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on three diverse datasets highlight the superior performance of PopFL compared to state-of-the-art FL techniques. The results show significant improvements in model accuracy, robustness, and fairness across various scenarios, effectively addressing the challenges of data heterogeneity and resource limitations. Through these innovations, PopFL paves the way for more reliable and efficient distributed learning systems, unlocking the full potential of FL in real-world applications where low latency and scalable solutions are critical.

AB Federated learning (FL) allows multiple medical institutions to collaboratively learn a global model without centralizing client data. It is difficult, if possible at all, for such a global model to commonly achieve optimal performance for each individual client, due to the heterogeneity of medical images from various scanners and patient demographics. This problem becomes even more significant when deploying the global model to unseen clients outside the FL with unseen distributions not presented during federated training. To optimize the prediction accuracy of each individual client for medical imaging tasks, we propose a novel unified framework for both Inside and Outside model Personalization in FL (IOP-FL). Our inside personalization uses a lightweight gradient-based approach that exploits the local adapted model for each client, by accumulating both the global gradients for common knowledge and the local gradients for client-specific optimization. Moreover, and importantly, the obtained local personalized models and the global model can form a diverse and informative routing space to personalize an adapted model for outside FL clients. Hence, we design a new test-time routing scheme using the consistency loss with a shape constraint to dynamically incorporate the models, given the distribution information conveyed by the test data. Our extensive experimental results on two medical image segmentation tasks present significant improvements over SOTA methods on both inside and outside personalization, demonstrating the potential of our IOP-FL scheme for clinical practice.

ID SCHEME
AB Understanding the latent disease patterns embedded in electronic health records (EHRs) is crucial for making precise and proactive healthcare decisions. Federated graph learning-based methods are commonly employed to extract complex disease patterns from the distributed EHRs without sharing the client-side raw data. However, the intrinsic characteristics of the distributed EHRs are typically non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID), significantly bringing challenges related to data imbalance and leading to a notable decrease in the effectiveness of making healthcare decisions derived from the global model. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel personalized federated learning framework named PEARL, which is designed for disease prediction on Non-IID EHRs. Specifically, PEARL incorporates disease diagnostic code attention and admission record attention to extract patient embeddings from all EHRs. Then, PEARL integrates self-supervised learning into a federated learning framework to train a global model for hierarchical disease prediction. To improve the performance of the client model, we further introduce a fine-tuning scheme to personalize the global model using local EHRs. During the global model updating process, a differential privacy (DP) scheme is implemented, providing a high-level privacy guarantee. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world MIMIC-III dataset validate the effectiveness of PEARL, demonstrating competitive results when compared with baselines.

AB Federated learning (FL) has been gaining popularity as a way to provide privacy-preserving data sharing for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). As a complementary, blockchain technology is used in recent literature to make FL secure. However, existing blockchain-based FL (BFL) solutions do not perform well when data in a BFL cluster are sparse. A direct solution is to collect as many devices as possible to establish a large BFL cluster. However, these devices may locate in geographically distant areas and be separated by great distance, which further results in high communication latency. The high latency will lead to BFL's low system efficiency due to frequent communications in the blockchain consensus. In this article, we propose that the large cluster should be divided into multiple smaller clusters, each in its own geographical area and organized with a BFL. In this context, we propose CFL, a cross-cluster FL system facilitated by the cross-chain technique. CFL connects multiple BFL clusters, where only a few aggregated updates are transmitted over long distances across clusters, thus improving the system efficiency. The design of CFL focuses on a cross-chain consensus protocol, which guarantees the model updates to be exchanged securely across clusters. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate CFL in comparison with BFL, and show both CFL's feasibility and efficiency.

AB Through deploying computing resources at the network edge, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) alleviates the contradiction between the high requirements of intelligent mobile applications and the limited capacities of mobile End Devices (EDs) in smart communities. However, existing solutions of computation offloading and resource allocation commonly rely on prior knowledge or centralized decision-making, which cannot adapt to dynamic MEC environments with changeable system states and personalized user demands, resulting in degraded Quality-of-Service (QoS) and excessive system overheads. To address this important challenge, we propose a novel Personalized Federated deep Reinforcement learning based computation Offloading and resource Allocation method (PFR-OA). This innovative PFR-OA considers the personalized demands in smart communities when generating proper policies of computation offloading and resource allocation. To relieve the negative impact of local updates on global model convergence, we design a new proximal term to improve the manner of only optimizing local Q-value loss functions in classic reinforcement learning. Moreover, we develop a new partial-greedy based participant selection mechanism to reduce the complexity of federated aggregation while endowing sufficient exploration. Using real-world system settings and testbed, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the PFR-OA. Compared to benchmark methods, the PFR-OA achieves better trade-offs between delay and energy consumption and higher task execution success rates under different scenarios.

AB The performance of federated learning (FL) over wireless networks depend on the reliability of the client-server connectivity and clients' local computation capabilities. In this article we investigate the problem of client scheduling and resource block (RB) allocation to enhance the performance of model training using FL, over a pre-defined training duration under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and limited local computing resources. First, we analytically derive the gap between the training losses of FL with clients scheduling and a centralized training method for a given training duration. Then, we formulate the gap of the training loss minimization over client scheduling and RB allocation as a stochastic optimization problem and solve it using Lyapunov optimization. A Gaussian process regression-based channel prediction method is leveraged to learn and track the wireless channel, in which, the clients' CSI predictions and computing power are incorporated into the scheduling decision. Using an extensive set of simulations, we validate the robustness of the proposed method under both perfect and imperfect CSI over an array of diverse data distributions. Results show that the proposed method reduces the gap of the training accuracy loss by up to 40.7% compared to state-of-the-art client scheduling and RB allocation methods.

AB In an era where collaborative data analysis and privacy protection are paramount, federated learning emerges as a transformative paradigm. This paper delves into integrating cryptographic techniques to fortify security and privacy in federated learning environments. To protect sensitive data and uphold privacy standards, Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) offer granular access control and secure computation, respectively. Additionally, secret sharing techniques safeguard model weights by preventing single points of failure. Our approach combines CP-ABE and CKKS encryption, enhancing privacy without sacrificing performance or accuracy, unlike differential privacy and traditional homomorphic encryption methods. To this end, we propose an efficient, secure aggregation method within the Federated Learning framework, using CP-ABE to secure initial global models and CKKS encryption for model parameters. Compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, our method demonstrates promising results while ensuring data privacy.

AB Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to jointly train a global learning model while keeping their training data locally, thereby protecting clients' privacy. However, there still exist some security issues in FL, e.g., the honest-but-curious servers may mine privacy from clients' model updates, and the malicious clients may launch poisoning attacks to disturb or break global model training. Moreover, most previous works focus on the security issues of FL in the presence of only honest-but-curious servers or only malicious clients. In this paper, we consider a stronger and more practical threat model in FL, where the honest-but-curious servers and malicious clients coexist, named as the non-fully trusted model. In the non-fully trusted FL, privacy protection schemes for honest-but-curious servers are executed to ensure that all model updates are indistinguishable, which makes malicious model updates difficult to detect. Toward this end, we present an Adaptive Privacy-Preserving FL (Ada-PPFL) scheme with Differential Privacy (DP) as the underlying technology, to simultaneously protect clients' privacy and eliminate the adverse effects of malicious clients on model training. Specifically, we propose an adaptive DP strategy to achieve strong client-level privacy protection while minimizing the impact on the prediction accuracy of the global model. In addition, we introduce DPAD, an algorithm specifically designed to precisely detect malicious model updates, even in cases where the updates are protected by DP measures. Finally, the theoretical analysis and experimental results further illustrate that the proposed Ada-PPFL enables client-level privacy protection with 35% DP-noise savings, and maintains similar prediction accuracy to models without malicious attacks.

Recent studies indicate that a city Digital Twin (DT) is beneficial for tackling this health crisis, because it can construct a virtual replica to simulate factors, such as climate conditions, response policies, and people's trajectories, to help plan efficient and inclusive decisions. However, a city DTsystem relies on long-term and high-quality data collection to make appropriate decisions, limiting its advantages when facing urgent crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Federated Learning (FL), in which all clients can learn a shared model while retaining all training data locally, emerges as a promising solution for accumulating the insights from multiple data sources efficiently Furthermore, the enhanced privacy protection settings removing the privacy barriers lie in this collaboration. In this work, we propose a framework that fused city DT with FL to achieve a novel collaborative paradigm that allows multiple city DTs to share the local strategy and status quickly. In particular, an FL central server manages the local updates of multiple collaborators (city DTs), providing a global model that is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems until the model gains the correlations between various response plans and infection trends. This approach means a collaborative city DT paradigm fused with FL techniques can obtain knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs and eventually establish a 'global view' of city crisis management. Meanwhile, it also helps improve each city's DT by consolidating other DT's data without violating privacy rules. In this paper, we use the COVID-19 pandemic as the use case of the proposed framework. The experimental results on a real dataset with various response plans validate our proposed solution and demonstrate its superior performance.

AB The local model poisoning attack is an attack to manipulate the shared local models during the process of distributed learning. Existing defense methods are passive in the sense that they try to mitigate the negative impact of the poisoned local models instead of eliminating them. In this paper, we leverage the new federated analytics paradigm, to develop a proactive defense method. More specifically, federated analytics is to collectively carry out analytics tasks without disclosing local data of the edge devices. We propose a Federated Anomaly Analytics enhanced Distributed Learning (FAA-DL) framework, where the clients and the server collaboratively analyze the anomalies. FAA-DL firstly detects all the uploaded local models and splits out the potential malicious ones. Then, it verifies each potential malicious local model with functional encryption. Finally, it removes the verified anomalies and aggregates the remaining to produce the global model. We analyze the FAA-DL framework and show that it is accurate, robust, and efficient. We evaluate FAA-DL by training classifiers on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST under various local model poisoning attacks. Our experiment results show FAA-DL improves the accuracy of the learned global model under strong attacks up to 6.90 times and outperforms the state-of-the-art defense methods with a robustness guarantee.

TI Client scheduling and bandwidth slicing for multiple federated learning

ID ALLOCATION; SELECTION
AB Federated Learning (FL) has attracted extensive attention in facilitating emerging edge intelligence applications for its inherent advantages of ensuring data security and privacy. Especially in the edge computing networks connected by Passive Optical Network (PON) system, FL is introduced to enable applications like autonomous driving, intelligent manufacturing, and precision medicine. However, in this system, the FL deployment over PON inevitably faces challenges induced by the conflict between a large volume of model data with the restrict latency limitation and the confined bandwidth resource of PON, especially for the multiple FL tasks. To address these issues, a novel scheme is proposed for tackling the client distribution and bandwidth allocation problems under the scenario of multiple simultaneous FL tasks supported by the multiple interconnected PON systems, which is consisted of the client scheduling and bandwidth slicing processes. To be specific, an easy-to-implement heuristic algorithm is first performed to assign the client numbers to PONs based on iterative method, with which certain operations are repetitively executed to achieve optimal solutions. And then, the serial bandwidth slicing which adapts the traditional policy, i.e., one-task-per-cycle, to the situation with multiple FL tasks, and parallel slicing with the multi-task-per-cycle, are designed for the investigated system. Furthermore, the simulation system is constructed to verify our method. The corresponding results exhibit that, the largest 43.2 % round time reduction is achieved by client scheduling compared to benchmark without the scheduling. Compared to the benchmark with serial slicing, our scheme can achieve a maximum 50.11 % of the round time decrease. It's also validated that, our proposed client scheduling and parallel bandwidth slicing method can improve the learning efficiency by reducing communication delay, especially for the situation with less client number and smaller FL threshold.

AB Due to the distributed characteristics of federated learning (FL), the vulnerability of the global model and the coordination of devices are the main obstacle. As a promising solution of decentralization, scalability, and security, leveraging the blockchain in FL has attracted much attention in recent years. However, the traditional consensus mechanisms designed for blockchain-like proof of work (PoW) would cause extreme resource consumption, which reduces the efficiency of FL greatly, especially when the participating devices are wireless and resource-limited. In order to address device asynchrony and anomaly detection in FL while avoiding the extra resource consumption caused by blockchain, this article introduces a framework for empowering FL using direct acyclic graph (DAG)-based blockchain systematically (DAG-FL). Accordingly, DAG-FL is first introduced from a three-layer architecture in detail, and then, two algorithms DAG-FL Controlling and DAG-FL Updating are designed running on different nodes to elaborate the operation of the DAG-FL consensus mechanism. After that, a Poisson process model is formulated to discuss that how to set deployment parameters to maintain DAG-FL stably in different FL tasks. The extensive simulations and experiments show that DAG-FL can achieve better performance in terms of training efficiency and model accuracy compared with the typical existing on-device FL systems as the benchmarks.

AB We present two novel federated learning (FL) schemes that mitigate the effect of straggling devices by introducing redundancy on the devices' data across the network. Compared to other schemes in the literature, which deal with stragglers or device dropouts by ignoring their contribution, the proposed schemes do not suffer from the client drift problem. The first scheme, CodedPaddedFL, mitigates the effect of stragglers while retaining the privacy level of conventional FL. It combines one-time padding for user data privacy with gradient codes to yield straggler resiliency. The second scheme, CodedSecAgg, provides straggler resiliency and robustness against model inversion attacks and is based on Shamir's secret sharing. We apply CodedPaddedFL and CodedSecAgg to a classification problem. For a scenario with 120 devices, CodedPaddedFL achieves a speed-up factor of 18 for an accuracy of 95% on the MNIST dataset compared to conventional FL. Furthermore, it yields similar performance in terms of latency compared to a recently proposed scheme by Prakash et al. without the shortcoming of additional leakage of private data. CodedSecAgg outperforms the state-of-the-art secure aggregation scheme LightSecAgg by a speed-up factor of 6.6-18.7 for the MNIST dataset for an accuracy of 95%.

ID CORE
AB A long-standing problem remains with the heterogeneous clients in Federated Learning (FL), who often have diverse gains and requirements for the trained model, while their contributions are hard to evaluate due to the privacy-preserving training. Existing works mainly rely on single-dimension metric to calculate clients' contributions as aggregation weights, which however may damage the social fairness, thus discouraging the cooperation willingness of worse-off clients and causing the revenue instability. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel incentive mechanism named FedLaw to effectively evaluate clients' contributions and further assign aggregation weights. Specifically, we reuse the local model updates and model the contribution evaluation process as a convex coalition game among multiple players with a non-empty core. By deriving a closed-form expression of the Shapley value, we solve the game core in quadratic time. Moreover, we theoretically prove that FedLaw guarantees individual fairness, coalition stability, computational efficiency, collective rationality, redundancy, symmetry, additivity, strict desirability, and individual monotonicity, and also show that FedLaw can achieve a constant convergence bound. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the superiority of FedLaw in terms of model aggregation, fairness, and time overhead compared to the state-of-the-art five baselines. Experimental results show that FedLaw is able to reduce the computation time of contribution evaluation by about 12 times and improve the global model performance by about 2% while ensuring fairness.

AB Open set domain adaptation (OSDA) methods have been proposed to leverage the difference between the source and target domains, as well as to recognize the known and unknown classes in the target domain. Such methods typically require the entire source and target data simultaneously to train the target model. However, in real scenarios, data are distributed and stored in various clients. They cannot be exchanged among clients because of privacy protection. Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized approach for training an effective global model with the training data distributed among the clients. Despite its potential in addressing the privacy concerns of data sharing, FL methods for OSDA that can handle unknown classes is not yet available. To tackle this problem, we have developed a novel federated OSDA (FOSDA) algorithm. More specifically, FOSDA adopts an uncertainty-aware mechanism to generate a global model from all client models. It reduces the uncertainty of the federated aggregation by focusing on the contribution of source clients with high uncertainty while retaining those with high consistency. Moreover, a federated class-based weighted strategy is also implemented in FOSDA to maintain the category information of the source clients. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of FOSDA.

AB Artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) have brought great convenience to people's everyday lives. With the emergence of edge computing, IoT devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can process data instantly at the point of generation, which significantly decreases the requirement for on-board processing power and minimises the data transfer time to enable real-time applications. Meanwhile, with federated learning (FL), UAVs can enhance their intelligent decision-making capabilities by learning from other UAVs without directly accessing their data. This facilitates rapid model iteration and improvement while safeguarding data privacy. However, in many UAV applications such as UAV logistics, different UAVs may perform different tasks and cover different areas, which can result in heterogeneous data and add to the problem of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data for model training. To address such a problem, we introduce a novel cloud-edge-end collaborative FL framework, which organises and combines local clients through clustering and aggregation. By employing the cosine similarity, we identified and integrated the most appropriate local model into the global model, which can effectively address the issue of Non-IID data in UAV logistics. The experimental results showed that our approach outperformed traditional FL algorithms on two real-world datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST.

TI FedSeq: A Hybrid Federated Learning Framework Based on Sequential

AB Federated learning (FL) enables multiple devices to collaboratively accomplish a machine learning task by iteratively exchanging their model updates instead of raw data with a parameter server (PS), thus protecting users' data privacy. Nevertheless, the communication efficiency and the nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data are remaining intractable challenges in FL. This article proposes a hybrid FL framework called FedSeq, based on user clustering and sequential in-cluster training, to improve the communication efficiency and the test accuracy, especially on non-IID data. The FedSeq first divides users into multiple clusters and selects a cluster head (CH) on behalf on each cluster to upload the model updates to the PS, thus drastically reducing the uplink communication overhead. Within each cluster, a sequential training method is designed, which enables the CHs' models witness more categories of training data and go through more meta-updates per training epoch, thus promoting the test accuracy. Moreover, we also provide the convergence analysis of FedSeq on IID data with Random user clustering, with specific experiments validating our theoretical analysis from a simulation perspective. In the experiments, we compare our FedSeq with other baselines, including FedSGD, FedAVG, FedProx, FedCluster, and HierFAVG, of which the results demonstrate that FedSeq outperforms other FL paradigms in terms of model accuracy and training efficiency. We also test FedSeq with Random and Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy clustering strategies to demonstrate the robustness of FedSeq to different clustering strategies. The FedSeq offers a potential solution to cope with non-IID data and reduce uplink communication overhead in FL.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have vastly improved. AI is now being used in a variety of applications to diagnose Breast Cancer (BC). However, most of the recent research has focused on centralized learning, which can pose privacy risks. In this paper, we propose a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework for the BC classification systems. The main objectives of this research are to improve data security and privacy, increase the accuracy of the Deep Learning (DL) model, and minimize energy consumption and related carbon emissions, which provides a way toward achieving green AI and sustainability goals. However, continuously transmitting model updates between the client and the server may cause lag and escalate host energy consumption. To minimize communication cost and simultaneously achieve the best accuracy, the proposed FL framework develops a new DL architecture for mammography classification, taking into account the optimal number of rounds between client hosts and the central server. The proposed DL architecture employs attention mechanisms, convolutional layers, and LSTMs to extract and analyze features and uses techniques to prevent overfitting and manage imbalanced data. The proposed FL framework is evaluated on three benchmark datasets. The results indicate that the proposed framework is more effective in detecting breast cancer compared to the recent approaches, achieving 95.17%, 100%, and 98.82% on the DDSM, INbreast, and Macrocalcification datasets, respectively.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques implemented at a large scale in intelligent transport systems (ITS), have considerably enhanced the vehicles' autonomous behaviour in making independent decisions about cyber threats, attacks, and faults. While, AI techniques are based on data sharing among the vehicles, it is important to note that sensitive data cannot be shared. Thus, federated learning (FL) has been implemented to protect privacy in vehicles. On the other hand, the integrity of data and the safety of aggregation are ensured by using blockchain technology. This paper applied classification approaches to VANET and ITS cyber-threats detection at the vehicle. Subsequently, by using blockchain and by applying an aggregation strategy to different models, models from the previous step were uploaded in a smart contract. Lastly, we returned the updated models to the vehicles. Furthermore, we conducted an experimental study to measure the effectiveness of the proposed prototype. In this paper, the VeReMi data set was distributed in a balanced manner into five parts in the experimental study. Thus, classification techniques were executed by each vehicle separately, and models were generated. Upon the aggregation of the models in blockchain, they were returned to the vehicles. Lastly, the vehicles updated their decision functions and accessed the precision and accuracy of cyber-threat detection. The results indicated that the precision and accuracy decreased by 7.1% on average with comparable F1-score and recall. Our solution ensures the privacy preservation of vehicles whereas blockchain guarantees the safety of aggregation technique and low gas consumption.

AB Anomaly detection for the Internet of Things (IoT) is a very important topic in the context of cyber-security. Indeed, as the pervasiveness of this technology is increasing, so is the number of threats and attacks targeting smart objects and their interactions. Behavioral fingerprinting has gained attention from researchers in this domain as it represents a novel strategy to model object interactions and assess their correctness and honesty. Still, there exist challenges in terms of the performance of such AI-based solutions. The main reasons can be alleged to scalability, privacy, and limitations on adopted Machine Learning algorithms. Indeed, in classical distributed fingerprinting approaches, an object models the behavior of a target contact by exploiting only the information coming from the direct interaction with it, which represents a very limited view of the target because it does not consider services and messages exchanged with other neighbors. On the other hand, building a global model of a target node behavior leveraging the information coming from the interactions with its neighbors, may lead to critical privacy concerns. To face this issue, the strategy proposed in this paper exploits Federated Learning to compute a global behavioral fingerprinting model for a target object, by analyzing its interactions with different peers in the network. Our solution allows the training of such models in a distributed way by relying also on a secure delegation strategy to involve less capable nodes in IoT. Moreover, through homomorphic encryption and Blockchain technology, our approach guarantees the privacy of both the target object and the different workers, as well as the robustness of the strategy in the presence of attacks. All these features lead to a secure fully privacy-preserving solution whose robustness, correctness, and performance are evaluated in this paper using a detailed security analysis and an extensive experimental campaign. Finally, the performance of our model is very satisfactory, as it consistently discriminates between normal and anomalous behaviors across all evaluated test sets, achieving an average accuracy value of 0.85.

AB Emotion recognition has attracted a lot of interest in recent years in various application areas such as healthcare and autonomous driving. Existing approaches to emotion recognition are based on visual, speech, or psychophysiological signals. However, recent studies are looking at multimodal techniques that combine different modalities for emotion recognition. In this work, we address the problem of recognizing the user's emotion as a driver from unlabeled videos using multimodal techniques. We propose a collaborative training method based on cross-modal distillation, i.e., "FedCMD" (Federated Cross-Modal Distillation). Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging collaborative decentralized learning technique that allows each participant to train their model locally to build a better generalized global model without sharing their data. The main advantage of FL is that only local data is used for training, thus maintaining privacy and providing a secure and efficient emotion recognition system. The local model in FL is trained for each vehicle device with unlabeled video data by using sensor data as a proxy. Specifically, for each local model, we show how driver emotional annotations can be transferred from the sensor domain to the visual domain by using cross-modal distillation. The key idea is based on the observation that a driver's emotional state indicated by a sensor correlates with facial expressions shown in videos. The proposed "FedCMD" approach is tested on the multimodal dataset "BioVid Emo DB" and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Experimental results show that our approach is robust to non-identically distributed data, achieving 96.67% and 90.83% accuracy in classifying five different emotions with IID (independently and identically distributed) and non-IID data, respectively. Moreover, our model is much more robust to overfitting, resulting in better generalization than the other existing methods.

AB This article proposes a blockchain-based federated learning (FL) framework with Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX)-based trusted execution environment (TEE) to securely aggregate local models in Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoTs). In FL, local models can be tampered with by attackers. Hence, a global model generated from the tampered local models can be erroneous. Therefore, the proposed framework leverages a blockchain network for secure model aggregation. Each blockchain node hosts an SGX-enabled processor that securely performs the FL-based aggregation tasks to generate a global model. Blockchain nodes can verify the authenticity of the aggregated model, run a blockchain consensus mechanism to ensure the integrity of the model, and add it to the distributed ledger for tamper-proof storage. Each cluster can obtain the aggregated model from the blockchain and verify its integrity before using it. We conducted several experiments with different CNN models and datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.

TI Anomaly Detection in Pedestrian Walkways for Intelligent Transportation

AB Anomaly detection in pedestrian walkways is a vital research area that uses remote sensing, which helps to optimize pedestrian traffic and enhance flow to improve pedestrian safety in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Engineers and researchers can formulate more potential techniques and tools with the power of computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) for mitigating potential safety hazards and identifying anomalies (i.e., vehicles) in pedestrian walkways. The real-world challenges of scenes and dynamics of environmental complexity cannot be handled by the conventional offline learning-based vehicle detection method and shallow approach. With recent advances in deep learning (DL) and ML areas, authors have found that the image detection issue ought to be devised as a two-class classification problem. Therefore, this study presents an Anomaly Detection in Pedestrian Walkways for Intelligent Transportation Systems using Federated Learning and Harris Hawks Optimizer (ADPW-FLHHO) algorithm on remote sensing images. The presented ADPW-FLHHO technique focuses on the identification and classification of anomalies, i.e., vehicles in the pedestrian walkways. To accomplish this, the ADPW-FLHHO technique uses the HybridNet model for feature vector generation. In addition, the HHO approach is implemented for the optimal hyperparameter tuning process. For anomaly detection, the ADPW-FLHHO technique uses a multi deep belief network (MDBN) model. The experimental results illustrated the promising performance of the ADPW-FLHHO technique over existing models with a maximum AUC score of 99.36%, 99.19%, and 98.90% on the University of California San Diego (UCSD) Ped1, UCSD Ped2, and avenue datasets, respectively. Therefore, the proposed model can be employed for accurate and automated anomaly detection in the ITS environment.

AB With the explosive network data due to the advanced development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the demand for multiparty computation is increasing. In addition, with the advent of future digital society, data have been gradually evolving into an effective virtual asset for sharing and usage. With the nature of the sensitivity, massiveness, fragmentation, and security of multiparty data computation in the IoT environment, we propose a secure data collaboration framework (FDC) based on federated deep-learning technology. The proposed framework can realize the secure collaboration of multiparty data computation on the premise that the data do not need to be transmitted out of their private data center. This framework is empowered by public data center, private data center, and the blockchain technology. The private data center is responsible for data governance, data registration, and data management. The public data center is used for multiparty secure computation. The blockchain paradigm is responsible for ensuring secure data usage and transmissions. A real IoT scenario is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TI FedHealth: A Federated Transfer Learning Framework for Wearable

DT Article
AB With the rapid development of computing technology, wearable devices make it easy to get access to people's health information. Smart healthcare achieves great success by training machine learning models on a large quantity of user personal data. However, there are two critical challenges. First, user data often exist in the form of isolated islands, making it difficult to perform aggregation without compromising privacy security. Second, the models trained on the cloud fail on personalization. In this article, we propose FedHealth, the first federated transfer learning framework for wearable healthcare to tackle these challenges. FedHealth performs data aggregation through federated learning, and then builds relatively personalized models by transfer learning. Wearable activity recognition experiments and real Parkinson's disease auxiliary diagnosis application have evaluated that FedHealth is able to achieve accurate and personalized healthcare without compromising privacy and security. FedHealth is general and extensible in many healthcare applications.

DT Article
DE Acute kidney injury (AKI); Federated learning (FL); Prediction model
AB PurposeTo address the contentious data sharing across hospitals, this study adopted a novel approach, federated learning (FL), to establish an aggregate model for acute kidney injury (AKI) prediction in critically ill patients in Taiwan.MethodsThis study used data from the Critical Care Database of Taichung Veterans General Hospital (TCVGH) from 2015 to 2020 and electrical medical records of the intensive care units (ICUs) between 2018 and 2020 of four referral centers in different areas across Taiwan. AKI prediction models were trained and validated thereupon. An FL-based prediction model across hospitals was then established.ResultsThe study included 16,732 ICU admissions from the TCVGH and 38,424 ICU admissions from the other four hospitals. The complete model with 60 features and the parsimonious model with 21 features demonstrated comparable accuracies using extreme gradient boosting, neural network (NN), and random forest, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of approximately 0.90. The Shapley Additive Explanations plot demonstrated that the selected features were the key clinical components of AKI for critically ill patients. The AUROC curve of the established parsimonious model for external validation at the four hospitals ranged from 0.760 to 0.865. NN-based FL slightly improved the model performance at the four centers.ConclusionA reliable prediction model for AKI in ICU patients was developed with a lead time of 24 h, and it performed better when the novel FL platform across hospitals was implemented.

AB As a promising solution to alleviate network congestion, mobile edge caching based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has emerged and received intensive research interests, where users could download their desired contents from UAVs with much lower latency. As for the UAV-assisted edge caching, to improve the users' Quality of Experience while reducing the cost on content updating, how to jointly design the trajectory and caching strategy for UAVs is critical. However, considering the dynamics and uncertainty on the traffic environment, as well as the mutual effect among different UAVs, such joint design is nontrivial. In this article, we propose a collaborative joint trajectory and caching scheme for UAV-assisted networks under the dynamic and uncertain traffic environment. Unlike most existing work relying on model-based or single-agent methods, we develop a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach to obtain the solution, where the specific content demand model is not needed and each UAV would learn the best decision autonomously based on its local observations. It can achieve the adaptive cooperation among different UAVs, while optimizing the overall network performance. Moreover, standing from the perspective on swarm intelligence, we further develop a dynamic clustering federated learning framework on the MADRL algorithm. By performing parameter fusion, each UAV can improve the learning efficiency.

AB The big data era has led to an exponential increase in data usage, resulting in significantly advancements in data-driven domains and data mining. However, due to privacy and regulatory requirements, sharing data among various institutions is not always possible. Federated learning can help address this problem, but existing studies that combine differential privacy with tree models have shown significant accuracy loss. In this study, we propose a Federated Differential Privacy Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (FDPBoost) that protects the private datasets of different owners while improving model accuracy. We select sensitive features according to the secure feature set indicator, and use an exponential mechanism to protect sensitive features and assign significant weight to the Laplace mechanism to protect leaf node values. Additionally, a distributed two -level boosting framework is designed to allocate the privacy budget between intra-iteration and inter-iteration decision trees while protecting model communication. The FDPBoost is tested on five datasets sourced from the materials and medical domains. Our experiments reveal that FDPBoost achieves competitive accuracy with traditional federated gradient boosting decision trees while also exhibiting a significant reduction in error rate as compared to PPGBDT (Zhao et al.) and FV-tree (Gao et al.). Notably, FDPBoost's error rate on the tumor-diagnosis dataset is 30% lower than that of FV-tree.

AB Face recognition has been widely used in personal authentication, especially on edge computing devices. However, face recognition systems suffer from face spoof attack. In this paper, a novel method for face spoof attack detection in edge computing scenarios is proposed. It is based on federated learning and improves traditional federated learning with multitask learning and manifold regularization, which is known as federated learning for face spoof attack detection (FedFSAD). In this way, local model learning is completed on edge devices and global model learning only depends on the trained local models without using the original image data. Besides, the performance is improved by imposing hypergraph manifold regularization in the global training of multitask learning. The results of comprehensive experiments show that the detection performance is improved by about 10% and robust against stragglers and network delays, which indicates the effectiveness of FedFSAD.

AB In various research domains, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained significant prominence, leading to the development of numerous learning-based models in research laboratories, which are evaluated using benchmark datasets. While the models proposed in previous studies may demonstrate satisfactory performance on benchmark datasets, translating academic findings into practical applications for industry practitioners presents challenges. This can entail either the direct adoption of trained academic models into industrial applications, leading to a performance decrease, or retraining models with industrial data, a task often hindered by insufficient data instances or skewed data distributions. Real-world industrial data is typically significantly more intricate than benchmark datasets, frequently exhibiting data-skewing issues, such as label distribution skews and quantity skews. Furthermore, accessing industrial data, particularly source code, can prove challenging for Software Engineering (SE) researchers due to privacy policies. This limitation hinders SE researchers' ability to gain insights into industry developers' concerns and subsequently enhance their proposed models. To bridge the divide between academic models and industrial applications, we introduce a federated learning (FL)-based framework called Almity. Our aim is to simplify the process of implementing research findings into practical use for both SE researchers and industry developers. Almity enhances model performance on sensitive skewed data distributions while ensuring data privacy and security. It introduces an innovative aggregation strategy that takes into account three key attributes: data scale, data balance, and minority class learnability. This strategy is employed to refine model parameters, thereby enhancing model performance on sensitive skewed datasets. In our evaluation, we employ two well-established SE tasks, i.e., code clone detection and defect prediction, as evaluation tasks. We compare the performance of Almity on both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models against two mainstream training methods, specifically the Centralized Training Method (CTM) and Vanilla Federated Learning (VFL), to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of Almity. Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework is not only feasible but also practical in real-world scenarios. Almity consistently enhances the performance of learning-based models, outperforming baseline training methods across all types of data distributions.

AB Heavy metals (HMs) in soil and water bodies greatly threaten human health. The wide separation of HMs urges the necessity to develop an expert system for HMs prediction and detection. In the current perspective, several propositions are discussed to design an innovative intelligence system for HMs prediction and detection in soil and water bodies. The intelligence system incorporates the Edge Cloud Server (ECS) data center, an innovative deep learning predictive model and the Federated Learning (FL) technology. The ECS data center is based on satellite sensing sources under human expertise ruling and HMs in-situ measurement. The FL system comprises a machine learning (ML) technique that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized edge servers holding local data samples without exchanging them or breaching data privacy. The expected outcomes of the intelli-gence system are to quantify the soil and water bodies' HMs, develop new modified HMs pollution contamination indices and provide decision-makers and environmental experts with an appropriate vision of soil, surface water, and crop health.

ID ACCESS
AB Federated learning (FL) is a popular privacy-preserving distributed training scheme, where multiple devices collaborate to train machine learning models by uploading local model updates. To improve communication efficiency, over-the-air computation (AirComp) has been applied to FL, which leverages analog modulation to harness the superposition property of radio waves such that numerous devices can upload their model updates concurrently for aggregation. However, the uplink channel noise incurs considerable model aggregation distortion, which is critically determined by the device scheduling and compromises the learned model performance. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic device scheduling framework for over-the-air FL, named PO-FL, to mitigate the negative impact of channel noise, where each device is scheduled according to a certain probability and its model update is reweighted using this probability in aggregation. We prove the unbiasedness of this aggregation scheme and demonstrate the convergence of PO-FL on both convex and non-convex loss functions. Our convergence bounds unveil that the device scheduling affects the learning performance through the communication distortion and global update variance. Based on the convergence analysis, we further develop a channel and gradient-importance aware algorithm to optimize the device scheduling probabilities in PO-FL. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed PO-FL framework with channel and gradient-importance awareness achieves faster convergence and produces better models than baseline methods.

AB Model-free techniques, such as machine learning (ML), have recently attracted much interest toward the physical layer design (e.g., symbol detection, channel estimation, and beamforming). Most of these ML techniques employ centralized learning (CLK) schemes and assume the availability of datasets at a parameter server (PS), demanding the transmission of data from edge devices, such as mobile phones, to the PS. Exploiting the data generated at the edge, federated learning (FL) has been proposed recently as a distributed learning scheme, in which each device computes the model parameters and sends them to the PS for model aggregation, while the datasets are kept intact at the edge. Thus, FL is more communication-efficient and privacy-preserving than CL and applicable to the wireless communication scenarios, wherein the data are generated at the edge devices. This article presents the recent advances in FL-based training for physical layer design problems. Compared to CL, the effectiveness of FL is presented in terms of communication overhead with a slight performance loss in the learning accuracy. The design challenges, such as model, data, and hardware complexity, are also discussed in detail along with possible solutions.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) autonomous driving technology based on deep learning has achieved great success. However, under the tunnel environment, the computer vision-based IoV may fail due to low illumination. In order to handle this issue, this paper deploys an image enhancement module at the terminal of the IoV to alleviate the low illumination influence. The enhanced images can be submitted through IoT to the cloud server for further processing. The core algorithm of image enhancement is implemented by a dynamic graph embedded transformer network based on federated learning which can fully utilize the data resources of multiple devices in IoV and improve the generalization. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted on the publicly available dataset and the self-built dataset which is collected under the tunnel environment. Compared with other deep models, all results confirm that the proposed graph embedded Transformer model can effectively enhance the detail information of the low-light image, which can greatly improve the following tasks in IoV.

AB Federated learning still faces many problems from research to technology implementation and the most critical problem is that the communication efficiency is not high. Therefore, the main task of this work is to improve the communication efficiency, affected by communication devices, bandwidth, data distribution and so on. Our work focus on two main aspects of federated learning - updates strategy and data heterogeneity, and propose a new federated framework called TKAGFL, which is composed by three key factors. Firstly, in response to the problem of data heterogeneity that often occurs in actual federated learning, federated generative adversarial networks are proposed as a method of data preprocessing. Secondly, the improved homomorphic encryption method counterbalances the conflicts between data-sharing and privacy protection. Thirdly, in the communication process, classic AdaGrad optimization in deep learning and top-K algorithms are combined to compress communication parameters to improve communication efficiency. The results of experiments demonstrate our TKAGFL framework's accuracy is about 15% - 20% better than other algorithms or frameworks and it can converge at 150 communication rounds and is 50 rounds faster than others. Also, our TKAGFL algorithm reduces 10 times communication volume than other algorithms,which is beneficial for federated learning application in industry.

AB Purpose Image artefacts continue to pose challenges in clinical molecular imaging, resulting in misdiagnoses, additional radiation doses to patients and financial costs. Mismatch and halo artefacts occur frequently in gallium-68 (Ga-68)-labelled compounds whole-body PET/CT imaging. Correcting for these artefacts is not straightforward and requires algorithmic developments, given that conventional techniques have failed to address them adequately. In the current study, we employed differential privacy-preserving federated transfer learning (FTL) to manage clinical data sharing and tackle privacy issues for building centre-specific models that detect and correct artefacts present in PET images. Methods Altogether, 1413 patients with Ga-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)/DOTA-TATE (TOC) PET/CT scans from 3 countries, including 8 different centres, were enrolled in this study. CT-based attenuation and scatter correction (CT-ASC) was used in all centres for quantitative PET reconstruction. Prior to model training, an experienced nuclear medicine physician reviewed all images to ensure the use of high-quality, artefact-free PET images (421 patients' images). A deep neural network (modified U2Net) was trained on 80% of the artefact-free PET images to utilize centre-based (CeBa), centralized (CeZe) and the proposed differential privacy FTL frameworks. Quantitative analysis was performed in 20% of the clean data (with no artefacts) in each centre. A panel of two nuclear medicine physicians conducted qualitative assessment of image quality, diagnostic confidence and image artefacts in 128 patients with artefacts (256 images for CT-ASC and FTL-ASC). Results The three approaches investigated in this study for Ga-68-PET imaging ( CeBa, CeZe and FTL) resulted in a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.42 +/- 0.21 (CI 95%: 0.38 to 0.47), 0.32 +/- 0.23 ( CI 95%: 0.27 to 0.37) and 0.28 +/- 0.15 (CI 95%: 0.25 to 0.31), respectively. Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon test revealed significant differences between the three approaches, with FTL outperforming CeBa and CeZe (p-value < 0.05) in the clean test set. The qualitative assessment demonstrated that FTL-ASC significantly improved image quality and diagnostic confidence and decreased image artefacts, compared to CT-ASC in Ga-68-PET imaging. In addition, mismatch and halo artefacts were successfully detected and disentangled in the chest, abdomen and pelvic regions in Ga-68-PET imaging. Conclusion The proposed approach benefits from using large datasets from multiple centres while preserving patient privacy. Qualitative assessment by nuclear medicine physicians showed that the proposed model correctly addressed two main challenging artefacts in Ga-68-PET imaging. This technique could be integrated in the clinic for 68Ga-PET imaging artefact detection and disentanglement using multicentric heterogeneous datasets.

DT Article
AB Data-driven machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising approach for building accurate and robust statistical models from medical data, which is collected in huge volumes by modern healthcare systems. Existing medical data is not fully exploited by ML primarily because it sits in data silos and privacy concerns restrict access to this data. However, without access to sufficient data, ML will be prevented from reaching its full potential and, ultimately, from making the transition from research to clinical practice. This paper considers key factors contributing to this issue, explores how federated learning (FL) may provide a solution for the future of digital health and highlights the challenges and considerations that need to be addressed.

AB Federated Learning (FL) is a promising privacy-preserving distributed machine learning paradigm. However, communication inefficiency remains the key bottleneck that impedes its large-scale implementation. Recently, hierarchical FL (HFL) has been proposed in which data owners, i.e., workers, can first transmit their updated model parameters to edge servers for intermediate aggregation. This reduces the instances of global communication and straggling workers. To enable efficient HFL, it is important to address the issues of edge association and resource allocation in the context of non-cooperative players, i.e., workers, edge servers, and model owner. However, the existing studies merely focus on static approaches and do not consider the dynamic interactions and bounded rationalities of the players. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical game framework to study the dynamics of edge association and resource allocation in self-organizing HFL networks. In the lower-level game, the edge association strategies of the workers are modelled using an evolutionary game. In the upper-level game, a Stackelberg differential game is adopted in which the model owner decides an optimal reward scheme given the expected bandwidth allocation control strategy of the edge server. Finally, we provide numerical results to validate that our proposed framework captures the HFL system dynamics under varying sources of network heterogeneity.

TI Fairness-Aware Federated Learning With Unreliable Links in
   Resource-Constrained Internet of Things
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL

DE Aggregation stability; convergence analysis; federated learning (FL);
   node fairness; resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT)
AB In order to make full use of the network data and guarantee user privacy simultaneously, federated learning (FL) is proposed to enable distributed intelligence for local nodes without sharing data with each other. However, in practice, due to resource limitations, traditional FL suffers from node scheduling and parameter transmission failure, which not only affects the final performance but also further reduces the fairness of the participating nodes. This article addresses the challenge and proposes an FL method to enhance the performance of FL on the basis of guaranteeing the fairness of the local nodes in a resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) network. Specifically, an analytical model is first constructed to characterize the performance of FL with joint considerations of node fairness, unreliable parameter transmissions as well as resource limitations. Thereafter, a statistically reweighted aggregation (SRA) scheme is proposed for parameter aggregation and the corresponding model is proved to be unbiased to that based on ideal parameter transmissions. With the knowledge of time dependency of the global model, we further extend SRA and propose a reliable SRA (RSRA) scheme. Additionally, we prove RSRA is able to achieve higher stability performance than SRA in model training. Furthermore, the convergence bound of the proposed RSRA is derived analytically, based on which an adaptive local training scheme is proposed under a given resource budget. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out with a public data set to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with comparisons of other baseline schemes.

TI Federated 3D multi-organ segmentation with partially labeled and

AB Purpose This paper considers a new problem setting for multi-organ segmentation based on the following observations. In reality, (1) collecting a large-scale dataset from various institutes is usually impeded due to privacy issues; (2) many images are not labeled since the slice-by-slice annotation is costly; and (3) datasets may exhibit inconsistent, partial annotations across different institutes. Learning a federated model from these distributed, partially labeled, and unlabeled samples is an unexplored problem.Methods To simulate this multi-organ segmentation problem, several distributed clients and a central server are maintained. The central server coordinates with clients to learn a global model using distributed private datasets, which comprise a small part of partially labeled images and a large part of unlabeled images. To address this problem, a practical framework that unifies partially supervised learning (PSL), semi-supervised learning (SSL), and federated learning (FL) paradigms with PSL, SSL, and FL modules is proposed. The PSL module manages to learn from partially labeled samples. The SSL module extracts valuable information from unlabeled data. Besides, the FL module aggregates local information from distributed clients to generate a global statistical model. With the collaboration of three modules, the presented scheme could take advantage of these distributed imperfect datasets to train a generalizable model.Results The proposed method was extensively evaluated with multiple abdominal CT datasets, achieving an average result of 84.83% in Dice and 41.62 mm in 95HD for multi-organ (liver, spleen, and stomach) segmentation. Moreover, its efficacy in transfer learning further demonstrated its good generalization ability for downstream segmentation tasks.Conclusion This study considers a novel problem of multi-organ segmentation, which aims to develop a generalizable model using distributed, partially labeled, and unlabeled CT images. A practical framework is presented, which, through extensive validation, has proved to be an effective solution, demonstrating strong potential in addressing this challenging problem.

AB Objective: We propose FedScore, a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for scoring system generation across multiple sites to facilitate cross-institutional collaborations. Materials and methods: The FedScore framework includes five modules: federated variable ranking, federated variable transformation, federated score derivation, federated model selection and federated model evaluation. To illustrate usage and assess FedScore's performance, we built a hypothetical global scoring system for mortality prediction within 30 days after a visit to an emergency department using 10 simulated sites divided from a tertiary hospital in Singapore. We employed a pre-existing score generator to construct 10 local scoring systems independently at each site and we also developed a scoring system using centralized data for comparison. Results: We compared the acquired FedScore model's performance with that of other scoring models using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The FedScore model achieved an average area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.763 across all sites, with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.020. We also calculated the average AUC values and SDs for each local model, and the FedScore model showed promising accuracy and stability with a high average AUC value which was closest to the one of the pooled model and SD which was lower than that of most local models. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that FedScore is a privacy-preserving scoring system generator with potentially good generalizability.

AB The recent advancement in next-generation Consumer Electronics (CE) has created the problems of information overload and information loss. The significance of Personalized Recommendation Systems (PRS) to efficiently and effectively extract useful user information is seen as an ideal solution to provide users with personalized content and services and therefore is used in different application domains including healthcare, e-commerce, social media, etc. Security and privacy are the two major challenges of the existing PRS for next-gen CE data. Federated learning (FL) has the potential to elevate the aforementioned challenges by sharing local recommender parameters while keeping all the training data on the device and therefore is seen as a promising technique to enhance security and privacy in PRS for the next-gen CE data. In this survey, we have first discussed the enhancement of the existing CE technologies, a holistic review of security and privacy challenges in current PRS, and the advantage of FL-based PRS for next-gen CE. Finally, we list a few open issues and challenges that can guide researchers and practitioners to further drive research in this promising area.

AB The issue of data privacy protection must be considered in distributed federated learning (FL) so as to ensure that sensitive information is not leaked. In this article, we propose a two-stage differential privacy (DP) framework for FL based on edge intelligence. Various levels of privacy preservation can be provided according to the degree of data sensitivity. In the first stage, the randomized response mechanism is used to perturb the original feature data by the user terminal for data desensitization, and the user can self-regulate the level of privacy preservation. In the second stage, noise is added to the local models by the edge server to further guarantee the privacy of the models. Finally, the model updates are aggregated in the cloud. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed end-edge-cloud FL framework in terms of training accuracy and convergence, extensive experiments are conducted on a real electrocardiogram (ECG) signal dataset. Bi-directional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural network is adopted to training classification model. The effect of different combinations of feature perturbation and noise addition on the model accuracy is analyzed depending on different privacy budgets and parameters. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed privacy-preserving framework provides good accuracy and convergence while ensuring privacy.

AB The ever-increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices are continuously generating huge masses of data, but the current cloud-centric approach for IoT big data analysis has raised public concerns on both data privacy and network cost. Federated learning (FL) recently emerges as a promising technique to accommodate these concerns, by means of learning a global model by aggregating local updates from multiple devices without sharing the privacy-sensitive data. However, IoT devices usually have constrained computation resources and poor network connections, making it infeasible or very slow to train deep neural networks (DNNs) by following the FL pattern. To address this problem, we propose a new efficient FL framework called FL-PQSU in this paper. It is composed of 3-stage pipeline: structured pruning, weight quantization and selective updating, that work together to reduce the costs of computation, storage, and communication to accelerate the FL training process. We study FL-PQSU using popular DNN models (AlexNet, VGG16) and publicly available datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10), and demonstrate that it can well control the training overhead while still guaranteeing the learning performance.

AB To support rapidly increasing services and applications from users, multi-tier computing is emerged as a promising system-level computing architecture by distributing computing/caching/communication/networking capabilities between cloud servers to users, especially deploying edge servers at network edges (e.g., base stations). However, due to heterogeneous content requests of users and a high-cost hit manner with direct hits, edge caching is still a most serious issue to be addressed. In this paper, we investigate the issue of recommendation-enabled edge caching in mobile two-tier (edge-cloud) computing networks. Particularly, we integrate recommender systems and edge caching to support both direct hits and soft hits and thus improve the resource utilization of edge servers. We model the factors affecting the user quality of experience as a comprehensive system cost and further formulate the problem as a multi-agent Markov decision process with the goal of minimizing the long-term average system cost. To address the formulated problem, we propose a decentralized recommendation-enabled edge caching framework that leverages a discrete multi-agent variant of soft actor-critic and federated learning. The proposed framework enables each edge server to learn its best policy locally and generate judicious decisions independently. Finally, trace-driven simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework converges to a better caching policy and outperforms several existing algorithms on average system cost reduction.

AB In distributed systems, data may partially overlap in sample and feature spaces, that is, horizontal and vertical data partitioning. By combining horizontal and vertical federated learning (FL), hybrid FL emerges as a promising solution to simultaneously deal with data overlapping in both sample and feature spaces. Due to its decentralized nature, hybrid FL is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, where malicious devices corrupt the global model by sending crafted model updates to the server. Existing work usually analyzes the statistical characteristics of all updates to resist model poisoning attacks. However, training local models in hybrid FL requires additional communication and computation steps, increasing the detection cost. In addition, due to data diversity in hybrid FL, solutions based on the assumption that malicious models are distinct from honest models may incorrectly classify honest ones as malicious, resulting in low accuracy. To this end, we propose a secure and efficient hybrid FL against model poisoning attacks. Specifically, we first identify two attacks to define how attackers manipulate local models in a harmful yet covert way. Then, we analyze the execution time and energy consumption in hybrid FL. Based on the analysis, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize training costs while guaranteeing accuracy considering the effect of attacks. To solve the formulated problem, we transform it into a Markov decision process and model it as a multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem. Then, we propose a malicious device detection (MDD) method based on MARL to select honest devices to participate in training and improve efficiency. In addition, we propose an alternative poisoned model detection (PMD) method considering model change consistency. This method aims to prevent poisoned models from being used in the model aggregation. Experimental results validate that under the random local model poisoning attack, the proposed MDD method can save over 50% training costs while guaranteeing accuracy. When facing the advanced adaptive local model poisoning (ALMP) attack, utilizing both the proposed MDD and PMD methods achieves the desired accuracy while reducing execution time and energy consumption.

AB Federated learning (FL)-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for vehicle road cooperation have attracted significant attention in recent years. However, the nonindependent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data across different edge devices, coupled with uneven computational power, impedes the detection accuracy and efficiency of FL-based IDSs deployed on such devices. To address these issues, this study introduces an efficient IDS to protect privacy of vehicle users using an improved residual network and a novel FL framework, named FEDSA-ResnetV2. First, the improved residual network SA-ResnetV2 is proposed, which adopts a core submodule named SA-ResnetV2-depthwise (SRD) that integrates the advantages of MobileNetV2, ShuffleNet V2, and Self-Attention mechanism for capturing key features of traffic data to effectively detect attacks. Second, the novel FL framework is built, which selects the optimal model globally to enhance detection accuracy, and integrates 8-bit post-quantization technique for resource-efficient edge deployment. To further improve FL training efficiency, an early stopping mechanism is employed. Experimental results show that FEDSA-ResnetV2 outperforms 11 recent Non-FL baselines and 3 state-of-the-art FL baselines in detection performance on three data sets, achieving a maximum performance increase of up to 34%. In terms of execution efficiency, it surpasses the optimal baseline in inference time, model size, mFlops, and parameters, reducing them by up to 72.6 times.

AB Signal modulation recognition is widely utilized in the field of spectrum detection, channel estimation, and interference recognition. With the development of artificial intelligence, substantial advances in signal recognition utilizing deep learning approaches have been achieved. However, a huge amount of data is required for deep learning. With increasing focus on privacy and security, barriers between data sources are sometimes difficult to break. This limits the data and renders them weak, so that deep learning is not sufficient. Federated learning can be a viable way of solving this challenge. In this article, we will examine the recognition of signal modulation based on federated learning with differential privacy, and the results show that the recognition rate is acceptable while data protection and security are being met.

AB To facilitate the deployment of machine learning in resource and privacy-constrained systems such as the Internet of Things, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a means for enabling edge devices to train a shared learning model while promoting privacy. However, Google's seminal FL algorithm requires all devices to be directly connected with a central controller, which limits its applications. In contrast, this article introduces a novel FL framework, called collaborative FL (CFL), which enables edge devices to implement FL with less reliance on a central controller. The fundamentals of this framework are developed and a number of communication techniques are proposed so as to improve CFL performance. An overview of centralized learning, Google's FL, and CFL is presented. For each type of learning, the basic architecture as well as its advantages, drawbacks, and operating conditions are introduced. Then four CFL performance metrics are presented, and a suite of communication techniques ranging from network formation, device scheduling, mobility management, to coding are introduced to optimize the performance of CFL. For each technique, future research opportunities are discussed. In a nutshell, this article showcases how CFL can be effectively implemented at the edge of large-scale wireless systems.

AB In this work, hierarchical federated learning (HFL) over wireless multi-cell networks is proposed for large-scale model training while preserving data privacy. However, the imbalanced data distribution has a significant impact on the convergence rate and learning accuracy. In addition, a large learning latency is incurred due to the traffic load imbalance among base stations (BSs) and limited wireless resources. To cope with these challenges, we first provide an analysis of the model error and learning latency in wireless HFL. Then, joint user association and wireless resource allocation algorithms are investigated under independent identically distributed (IID) and non-IID training data, respectively. For the IID case, a learning latency aware strategy is designed to minimize the learning latency by optimizing user association and wireless resource allocation, where a mobile device selects the BS with the maximal uplink channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For the non-IID case, the total data distribution distance and learning latency are jointly minimized to achieve the optimal user association and resource allocation. The results show that both data distribution and uplink channel SNR should be taken into consideration for user association in the non-IID case. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by the simulations.

AB Wireless federated learning (FL) is envisioned as a promising paradigm of distributed learning in wireless networks without disclosing users' data privacy. However, radio channel leads to a potential risk of eavesdropping attack when sending the trained model data in wireless networks. To address this eavesdropping attack, in this work, we propose an energy-efficient wireless FL by using artificial jamming. Specifically, the group of wireless devices (WDs) adopt the time division multiple access (TDMA) approach to send their locally trained models to the FL server for model aggregation subject to the eavesdropping attack of a malicious node. When one of the WDs sends its local model, all the other WDs send the artificial jamming signals to interfere with the eavesdropper, which helps increase the secrecy throughput of the targeted WD for uploading its local model. Different from many existing studies using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we adopt the stochastic average gradient (SAG) method in the local training to improve the convergence of FL and derive the corresponding lower bound of the FL convergence rate via SAG. Furthermore, we formulate an optimization problem that aims at minimizing the energy consumption of the WDs by jointly optimizing different WDs' local training time, their uploading transmission time in TDMA and the transmit-powers for providing artificial jamming, as well as the FL configurations of the local/global iterations. We also propose an efficient algorithm for solving this non-convex optimization problem. Numerical results are illustrated to validate the advantages of our design of wireless FL and the corresponding algorithms. In particular, the results demonstrate that our secrecy oriented energy-efficient FL can significantly outperform the other heuristic FL schemes.

AB With the rapid advance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the surging user-centric smart devices, video services such as short videos, real -time video streaming, and Virtual Reality (VR) gaming are emerging. Traditional cloud-centric caching is no longer able to satisfy the low-latency needs of mobile user groups. Predicting the most popular content in advance and caching it on edge devices such as small base stations (SBS) is a promising solution to alleviate network congestion and supply better Quality of Service (QoS) for mobile users. However, frequently changing popular content, limited edge caching resources, privacy of user data, and user mobility pose significant challenges to edge video caching. To tackle these challenges, we propose an efficient asynchronous federated learning (AFL)-based mobility-aware proactive video caching scheme (AFMPVC), which significantly improves the overall network performance while preventing the risk of user data leakage. First, we model the proactive video caching problem in mobile edge computing systems and consider the impact of user mobility on AFL, representing the problem as an autoencoder (AE) model loss minimization problem. Then, a proactive video caching algorithm is proposed based on a filtering model, which uses the hidden features obtained from the trained AE model to compute the user similarity to find the popular videos that are most likely to be accessed by users and combine them with the most frequently requested videos. Meanwhile, we take into account the short duration of high mobility users staying on the current SBS and cache some videos to neighboring edge servers to have more redundant space to store more less popular videos. Finally, experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the presented caching scheme outperforms other baseline caching schemes with respect to cache hit rate and latency reduction.

AB The ability to predict diseases is critical in healthcare for early intervention and better patient outcomes. Data security and privacy significantly classified medical data from several institutions is analyzed. Cooperative model training provided by Federated Learning (FL), preserves data privacy. In this study, we offer a fusion strategy for illness prediction, combining FL with Anova and Chi-Square Feature Selection (FS) and Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) Feature Extraction (FE) techniques. This research aims to use FS and FE techniques to improve prediction performance while using the beneficial aspects of FL. A comprehensive analysis of the distributed data is ensured by updating aggregate models with information from all participating institutions. Through collaboration, a robust disease prediction system excels in the limited possibilities of individual datasets. We assessed the fusion strategy on the Cleveland heart disease and diabetes datasets from the UCI repository. Comparing the fusion strategy to solo FL or conventional ML techniques, the prediction performance a unique fusion methodology for disease prediction. Our proposed models, Chi-Square with LDA and Anova with LDA leveraging FL, exhibited exceptional performance on the diabetes dataset, achieving identical accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score of 92.3%, 94.36%, 94.36, and 94.36%, respectively. Similarly, on the Cleveland heart disease dataset, these models demonstrated significant performance, achieving accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score of 88.52%, 87.87%, 90.62, and 89.23%, respectively. The results have the potential to revolutionize disease prediction, maintain privacy, advance healthcare, and outperform state-of-the-art models.

ID RESIDUAL LIFE
AB Most prognostic methods require a decent amount of data for model training. In reality, however, the amount of historical data owned by a single organization might be small or not large enough to train a reliable prognostic model. To address this challenge, this article proposes a federated prognostic model that allows multiple users to jointly construct a failure time prediction model using their multi-stream, high-dimensional, and incomplete data while keeping each user's data local and confidential. The prognostic model first employs multivariate functional principal component analysis to fuse the multi-stream degradation signals. Then, the fused features coupled with the times-to-failure are utilized to build a (log)-location-scale regression model for failure prediction. To estimate parameters using distributed datasets and keep the data privacy of all participants, we propose a new federated algorithm for feature extraction. Numerical studies indicate that the performance of the proposed model is the same as that of classic non-federated prognostic models and is better than that of the models constructed by each user itself.

AB This paper introduces a sophisticated approach to network security, with a primary emphasis on utilizing deep learning for intrusion detection. In real-world scenarios, the high dimensionality of training data poses challenges for simple deep learning models and can lead to vanishing gradient issues with complex neural networks. Additionally, uploading network traffic data to a central server for training raises privacy concerns. To tackle these issues, the paper introduces a Residual Network (ResNet)-based deep learning model trained using a federated learning approach. The ResNet effectively tackles the vanishing gradient problem, while federated learning enables multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or clients to engage in joint training without sharing their data with third parties. This approach enhances accuracy through collaborative learning while maintaining privacy. Experimental results on the X-IIoTID dataset indicate that the proposed model outperforms conventional deep learning and machine learning methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics used for evaluation. Specifically, the proposed methodology achieved 99.43% accuracy in a centralized environment and 99.16% accuracy in a federated environment.

AB Although there are significant advantages to the popular use of connected devices on the Internet of Everything, there remain distinct concerns surrounding privacy. Federated learning has been one of the solutions suggested to remediate such issues and looks promising given the collaborative model it provides, which is shared across local gradients Grds s without the exposure of raw data. However, the shared Grds s threaten the local data with a privacy risk. The central server could produce summarized results. Besides, in federated learning devices with resource constraints frequently dropout. There are only two possible solutions now: efficiency or privacy preservation. Designing a verifiable secure aggregation on the scale of federated learning is still a difficult test. Here, an efficient privacy-preserving federated learning protocol is proposed, with a secure data aggregation for the Internet of Everything. Aggregator encryption effectively masks the local Grds s of clients. The central server aggregates the obscured Grds s without exposing the local data. At the same time, clients can effectively verify whether the aggregated result is correct. Secondly, the suggested protocol employs a group management mechanism to tolerate the dropout of clients without negatively affecting their further participation in subsequent learning activities. Security analysis shows that the protocol guarantees privacy- preserving federated learning's security demand. The results of experiments carried out on datasets reveal the highly efficient practical performance of the proposed protocol.

AB This paper designs a novel energy-efficient hybrid federated and centralized learning (HFCL) framework for training wireless traffic prediction models in aerial networks over distributed multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers where multiple network data analytics functions (NWDAFs) are embedded in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided MEC servers according to the framework standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specification. Here, UAVs can use federated learning (FL) with their part of local datasets, while the remaining local datasets can be offloaded to the centralized server for centralized learning (CL). To achieve such HFCL energy-efficiently for battery-constrained UAVs, we propose an energy-efficient computation offloading (ECO) scheme for the HFCL. We rigorously formulate analytical models for the overall energy consumption at MEC servers on UAVs and total latency for HFCL process based on the amount of offloaded datasets at each UAV. Here the energy consumption includes i) the transmission energy consumption for offloading the local dataset and ii) the energy consumption for FL processing, which includes local training and local model uploading. To balance between the overall energy consumption and total latency during HFCL process while preventing overload at UAVs, we propose a theoretical framework for the ECO problem that optimizes the amount of offloaded local datasets over multiple UAVs on aerial networks. Here, the ECO problem is formulated as the convex optimization problem under the continuous domain of the amount of offloaded datasets. Our numerical and simulation results show that our proposed framework can construct wireless traffic prediction models with an acceptable training accuracy in an energy-efficient manner over various benchmarks by striking a balance between energy consumption and overall training latency.

AB Federated learning is a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm where multiple devices collaboratively train a model, which is applicable to edge computing environments. However, the non-IID data distributed in multiple devices degrades the performance of the federated model due to severe weight divergence. This paper presents a clustered federated learning framework named cFedFN for visual classification tasks in order to reduce the degradation. Especially, this framework introduces the computation of feature norm vectors in the local training process and divides the devices into multiple groups by the similarities of the data distributions to reduce the weight divergences for better performance. As a result, this framework gains better performance on non-IID data without leakage of the private raw data. Experiments on various visual classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of this framework over the state-of-the-art clustered federated learning frameworks.

TI RETRACTED: Design of Sponsored Search Auction Mechanism for Federated
   Learning Advertising Platform (Retracted Article)

LA English
DT Article; Retracted Publication
ID WELFARE
AB Federated learning has demonstrated strong capabilities in terms of addressing concerns related to data islands and privacy protection. However, in real application scenarios, participants in federated learning have difficulty matching. For example, two companies distributed in different regions do not know that the other party also needs federated learning in the case of information asymmetry. Therefore, it is difficult to build alliances. To enable suppliers and consumers to find one or more federated learning objects that are relatively satisfactory in a short time, this paper considers the idea of establishing a federated learning advertising platform, where data transactions need to consider privacy protection. A sponsored search auction mechanism design method is introduced to solve the problem of ranking the presentation order of participant advertisements. Due to the potential malicious bidding problem, which occurs when using the classic sponsored search auction mechanism under the federated learning scenario, this paper proposes a novel federated sponsored search auction mechanism based on the Myerson theorem, improving upon the ranking index used in the classic sponsored search auction mechanism. A large number of experimental results on a simulation data set show that our proposed method can fairly select and rank the data providers participating in the bidding. Compared with other benchmark mechanisms, the malicious bidding rate is significantly decreased. In the long run, the proposed mechanism can encourage more data providers to participate in the federated learning platform, thus continuously promoting the establishment of a federated learning ecosystem.

AB As the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) continues to grow in scale, edge devices will generate massive amounts of data every single day. However, most of the IIoT data exists in the form of data silos, which makes it difficult to share data across domains securely. Therefore, a secured data-sharing scheme for IIoT based on blockchain and federated learning (FL) is proposed in this article. Leveraging blockchain in FL systems to enhance the tamper-proof and decentralized capabilities of IIoT devices. Model parameter validation and incentives are also added to the consensus algorithm to encourage more IIoT data owners to contribute local privacy data and arithmetic power. To address potential security issues, such as parameter leakage and inference attacks in data sharing, this article designs an adaptive differential privacy mechanism and a node contribution consensus mechanism. Without affecting the global model's accuracy, some of the noise is also reduced. The reputation mechanism is used to resist poisoning attacks by malicious nodes. It is demonstrated on different data sets that our scheme has high global model accuracy and can effectively resist 30% model poisoning attacks.

AB In recent years, along with the extensive application of consumer electronics, the task execution with cloud computing for big data has become one of the research focuses. Nevertheless, the traditional theories and algorithms are still employed by existing research work to explore the feasible solutions, which takes a beating from low generalization performance, system load imbalance, more response delay, etc. To solve the matter, a task execution method called DROP (Deep Reinforcement network aided Optimization method aiming at task Processing) has been put forward, which is capable of completing task request allocation through virtual network embedding. The prominence of this method is explained by its effect in reducing load balancing degree, minimizing bandwidth resource overhead, and preserving electric energy as well as meeting customer demands. It makes use of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) instead of depending on tons of iterations for better path selection schemes in previous methods, through continuous environment interaction and trial-anderror evaluation to get better strategy selection for virtual link embedding. To realize the virtual node embedding in the federated optimization based system architecture, the intentional deep feature learning network is applied. Compared with the cutting edge approaches, the performance benefits of DROP can be verified by the experimental results in terms of bringing down the extra cost on resources and energy of the substrate network during the task execution for big data.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning method where clients collaboratively train a global model without exchanging local data. However, recent works reveal that potential privacy leakage occurs when clients upload their local updates. Although some works have studied privacy-preserving mechanisms in FL, the selfish privacy-preserving behaviors of clients are yet to be explored. In this paper, we formulate clients' privacy-preserving behaviors in cross-silo FL as a multi-stage privacy preservation game, where each stage game corresponds to one training iteration. Specifically, clients selfishly perturb their local updates in each training iteration to trade off between convergence performance and privacy loss. To analyze the game, we first derive a novel theoretical bound to characterize the impact of clients' local perturbations on the convergence of FL through analyzing the corrective effect of gradient descent in model training. With the novel convergence bound, we prove that the multi-stage privacy preservation game admits a unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE). We show that at the SPNE, the magnitude of each client's local perturbation decreases geometrically with training iterations. We then show that the efficiency decreases with the number of clients in some cases. To tackle this problem, we propose a socially efficient incentive mechanism that guarantees individual rationality, budget balance, and social efficiency. We further propose a truthful mechanism that achieves approximate social efficiency. Simulation results show that our proposed mechanisms can decrease clients' total cost by up to 58.08% compared with that at the SPNE.

AB Ubiquitous intelligence has been widely recognized as a critical vision of the future sixth generation (6G) networks, which implies intelligence over the whole network from the core to the edge, including end devices. Nevertheless, fulfilling this vision, particularly the intelligence at the edge, is extremely challenging due to the limited resources of edge devices as well as the ubiquitous coverage envisioned by 6G. To empower edge intelligence, in this article, we propose a framework called air-ground integrated federated learning (AGIFL), which organically integrates air-ground integrated networks and federated learning (FL). In AGIFL, leveraging the flexible on-demand 3D deployment of aerial nodes such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), all the nodes can collaboratively train an effective learning model by FL. We also conduct a case study to evaluate the effect of two different deployment schemes of UAVs on learning and network performance. Last but not least, we highlight several technical challenges and future research directions in AGIFL.

AB Tree-based models are wildly adopted in various real-world scenarios. Recently, there is a growing interest in vertical federated tree-based model learning to build tree-based models by exploiting data from multiple organizations without violating data privacy regulations. However, most existing work focuses on batch learning settings where all training samples are prepared at once. They cannot be applied to scenarios where local samples come in a streaming manner. Additionally, the present federated learning algorithms suffer from inference attacks. In this paper, we present a novel solution that enables different organizations to jointly train a tree-based model in an incremental and privacy-preserving manner. Our solution is based on Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) for incrementally building a tree model. Since data statistics exchanged in the training process may implicitly disclose private information, we propose a protection mechanism based on order-preserving encryption. To further improve the efficiency of the solution, we compress the size of statistics by means of regional counting, which not only maintains model accuracy but also enhances privacy. We conduct extensive experiments on various real-world datasets and the results show the superiority of our solution in terms of both efficiency and privacy.

TI High-accuracy low-cost privacy-preserving federated learning in IoT
   systems via adaptive perturbation

AB With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), federated learning (FL) has been widely used to obtain insights from collected data while preserving data privacy. Differential privacy (DP) is an additive noise scheme that has been widely studied as a privacy-preserving approach on FL. However, privacy protection under DP usually comes at the cost of model accuracy for the underlying FL process. In this paper, we propose a novel low-cost (for both communication and computational overhead) adaptive noise perturbation/masking scheme to protect FL clients' privacy without degrading the global model accuracy. In particular, we set the magnitude of the additive noise to adaptively change with the magnitude of the local model updates. Then, a direction-based filtering scheme is used to accelerate the convergence of the FL model. A maximum tolerable noise bound for local clients is derived using the central limit theorem (CLT). The designed noise maximizes privacy protection for clients while preserving the accuracy and convergence rate of the FL model , as a result of the noise cancelling out and forming a more concentrated distribution after the aggregation operation on the server. We theoretically prove that FL with the proposed noise perturbation scheme retains the same accuracy and convergence rate (O(1/T) for convex loss functions and O(1/root T) for non-convex loss functions) as that of non-private FL with SGD. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of convergence behavior, computational efficiency, and privacy protection against state-of-the-art privacy inference attacks on real-world datasets. Experimental results show that FL with our proposed perturbation scheme outperforms DP in the accuracy and convergence rate of the FL model in both client dropout and non -client dropout scenarios. Compared with DP, our proposed scheme does not incur additional computational and communication overhead. Our approach provides DP-comparable or better effectiveness in defending against privacy attacks under the same global model accuracy.

TI Evaluating site-of-care-related racial disparities in kidney graft

AB Objectives Racial disparities in kidney transplant access and posttransplant outcomes exist between non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients in the United States, with the site of care being a key contributor. Using multi-site data to examine the effect of site of care on racial disparities, the key challenge is the dilemma in sharing patient-level data due to regulations for protecting patients' privacy.Materials and Methods We developed a federated learning framework, named dGEM-disparity (decentralized algorithm for Generalized linear mixed Effect Model for disparity quantification). Consisting of 2 modules, dGEM-disparity first provides accurately estimated common effects and calibrated hospital-specific effects by requiring only aggregated data from each center and then adopts a counterfactual modeling approach to assess whether the graft failure rates differ if NHB patients had been admitted at transplant centers in the same distribution as NHW patients were admitted.Results Utilizing United States Renal Data System data from 39 043 adult patients across 73 transplant centers over 10 years, we found that if NHB patients had followed the distribution of NHW patients in admissions, there would be 38 fewer deaths or graft failures per 10 000 NHB patients (95% CI, 35-40) within 1 year of receiving a kidney transplant on average.Discussion The proposed framework facilitates efficient collaborations in clinical research networks. Additionally, the framework, by using counterfactual modeling to calculate the event rate, allows us to investigate contributions to racial disparities that may occur at the level of site of care.Conclusions Our framework is broadly applicable to other decentralized datasets and disparities research related to differential access to care. Ultimately, our proposed framework will advance equity in human health by identifying and addressing hospital-level racial disparities.

AB Federated learning (FL) enables edge devices to cooperatively train models without exposing their raw data. However, implementing a practical FL system at the network edge mainly faces three challenges: label noise, data non-IIDness, and device heterogeneity, which seriously harm model performance and slow down convergence speed. Unfortunately, none of the existing works tackle all three challenges simultaneously. To this end, we develop a novel FL system, called Aorta, which features adaptive dataset construction and aggregation weight assignment. On each client, Aorta first calibrates potentially noisy labels and then constructs a training dataset with low noise, balanced distribution, and proper size. To fully utilize limited data on clients, we propose a global model guided method to select clean data and progressively correct noisy labels. To achieve balanced class distribution and proper dataset size, we propose a distribution-and-capability-aware data augmentation method to generate local training data. On the server, Aorta assigns aggregation weights based on the quality of local models to ensure that high-quality models have a greater influence on the global model. The model quality is measured through its cosine similarity with a benchmark model, which is trained on a clean and balanced dataset. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets with various settings, including different noise types/ratios and non-IID types/levels. Compared to the baselines, Aorta improves model accuracy up to 9.8% on the datasets with moderate noise and non-IIDness, while providing a speedup of 4.2x on average when achieving the same target accuracy.

AB Unauthorized users may attack centralized controllers as an attractive target in software-defined networking (SDN)-based industrial cyber-physical systems (CPS). Managing high-complexity deep learning (DL)-based intrusion classification to recognize and prevent attacks in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks with low-latency requirements is challenging. Moreover, a centralized DL-based intrusion detection system (IDS) leads to privacy concerns and communication overhead issues during data uploading to a cloud server for training processes in IIoT environments. This study proposes federated learning (FL)-based low-complexity intrusion detection and classification in SDN-enabled industrial CPS. This framework utilizes Chi-square and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) feature selection methods to select potential features, which help reduce the model's complexity and boost performance. The proposed model evaluated the SDN and IIoT-related InSDN and Edge-IIoTset datasets. The model measurement shows that the proposed model achieves high accuracy, low computational cost, and a low-complexity model architecture compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

AB We present a novel privacy-preserving federated adversarial domain adaptation approach ( PrADA ) to address an under-studied but practical cross-silo federated domain adaptation problem, in which the party of the target domain is insufficient in both samples and features. We handle the lack-of-feature issue by extending the feature space through vertical federated learning with a feature-rich party and tackle the sample-scarce issue by performing adversarial domain adaptation from the sample-rich source party to the target party. In this work, we focus on financial applications where interpretability is critical. However, existing adversarial domain adaptation methods typically apply a single feature extractor to learn low-interpretable feature representations with respect to the target task. To improve interpretability, we exploit domain expertise to categorize the feature space into multiple groups that each group holds tightly relevant features, and we learn a semantically meaningful high-order feature from each feature group. In addition, we apply a fine-grained domain adaptation to each feature group to improve transferability. We design a privacy-preserving vertical federated learning framework that enables performing the PrADA securely and efficiently. We evaluate our approach based on two tabular datasets. Experiments demonstrate both the effectiveness and practicality of our approach.

AB In digital healthcare applications, anomaly detection is an important task to be taken into account. For instance, in ECG (Electrocardiogram) analysis, the aim is often to detect abnormal ECG signals that are considered outliers. For such tasks, it has been shown that deep learning models such as Autoencoders (AEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can provide state-of-the-art performance. However, they suffer from certain limitations. For example, the trivial method of threshold selection does not perform well if we do not know the reconstruction loss distribution in advance. In addition, since healthcare applications rely on highly sensitive personal information, data privacy concerns can arise when data are collected and processed in a centralized machine-learning setting. Hence, in order to address these challenges, in this paper, we propose AnoFed, a novel framework for combining the transformer-based AE and VAE with the Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) in a federated setting. It can enhance privacy protection, improve the explainability of results and support adaptive anomaly detection. Using ECG anomaly detection as a typical application of the framework in healthcare, we conducted experiments to show that the proposed framework is not only effective (in terms of the detection performance) but also efficient (in terms of computational costs), compared with a number of state-of-the-art methods in the literature. AnoFed is very lightweight in terms of the number of parameters and computation, hence it can be used in applications with resource-constrained edge devices.

AB Energy harvesting (EH) is a promising and critical technology to mitigate the dilemma between the limited battery capacity and the increasing energy consumption in the Internet of everything. However, the current EH system suffers from energy-information cross threats, facing the overlapping vulnerability of energy deprivation and private information leakage. Although some existing works touch on the security of energy and information in EH, they treat these two issues independently, without collaborative and intelligent protection cross the energy side and information side. To address the aforementioned challenge, this article proposes a joint protection framework of energy security and information privacy for EH with an incentive federated learning approach. First, we design a federated-learning-based malicious energy user detection method according to energy status and behaviors to provide energy security protection. Second, a differential-privacy-empowered information preservation scheme is devised, where sensitive information is perturbed and protected by the customized demand-based noise. Third, a noncooperative-game-enabled incentive mechanism is established to encourage EH nodes to participate in the joint energy-information protection system. The proposed incentive mechanism derives the optimal energy-information security strategy for EH nodes and achieve a tradeoff between the protection of energy security and information privacy. Evaluation results have verified the effectiveness of our proposed joint protection mechanism.

AB Over the past few years, fog radio access networks (F-RANs) have become a promising paradigm to support the tremendously increasing demands of multimedia services, by pushing computation and storage functionalities toward the edge of networks, closer to users. In F-RANs, distributed edge caching among fog access points (F-APs) can effectively reduce network traffic and service latency as it places popular contents at local caches of F-APs rather than the remote cloud. Due to the limited caching resources of F-APs and spatiotemporally fluctuant content demands from users, many cooperative caching schemes were designed to decide which contents are popular and how to cache them. However, these approaches often collect and analyze the data from Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices at a central server to predict the content popularity for caching, which raises serious privacy issues. To tackle this challenge, we propose a federated learning-based cooperative hierarchical caching scheme (FLCH), which keeps data locally and employs IoT devices to train a shared learning model for content popularity prediction. FLCH exploits horizontal cooperation between neighbor F-APs and vertical cooperation between the baseband unit (BBU) pool and F-APs to cache contents with different degrees of popularity. Moreover, FLCH integrates a differential privacy mechanism to achieve a strict privacy guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that FLCH outperforms five important baseline schemes in terms of the cache hit ratio, while preserving data privacy. Moreover, the results show the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative hierarchical caching mechanism for FLCH.

TI Secure and Efficient Smart Healthcare System Based on Federated Learning

AB The rapid development of smart healthcare system in the Internet of Things (IoT) has made the early detection of many chronic diseases more convenient, quick, and economical. However, when healthcare organizations collect users' health data through deployed IoT devices, there are issues of compromising users' privacy. In view of this situation, this paper introduces federated learning technology to solve the problem of data security. In this paper, we consider the two main problems of federated learning applications in IoT smart healthcare system: (1) how to reduce the time overhead of system running and (2) how to authenticate that the user device uploading data is deployed by the system itself. To solve the above problems, we propose the first federated learning scheme based on full dynamic secret sharing. First, we use a two-mask protocol to keep the user's local model parameters confidential during federated learning. Then, based on homogeneous linear recursive equation, homomorphic hash function, and elliptic curve cryptosystem, the full dynamic secret sharing and user identity authentication are realized. In addition, our scheme allows users to join or quit during training. Finally, we have carried out simulation test on this scheme. The experimental results show that the efficiency of our scheme is improved by about 60% on average in the case of no user dropping and by about 30% in the case of some users dropping.

AB The annotation of ambiguous or subjective NLP tasks is usually addressed by various annotators. In most datasets, these annotations are aggregated into a single ground truth. However, this omits divergent opinions of annotators, hence missing individual perspectives. We propose FLEAD (Federated Learning for Exploiting Annotators' Disagreements), a methodology built upon federated learning to independently learn from the opinions of all the annotators, thereby leveraging all their underlying information without relying on a single ground truth. We conduct an extensive experimental study and analysis in diverse text classification tasks to show the contribution of our approach with respect to mainstream approaches based on majority voting and other recent methodologies that also learn from annotator disagreements.

AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) has become a more and more popular technology, which plays a very important role in various fields. In view of the task of offloading of multiple users, most of the existing studies do not take into account data sharing and cooperation among users, which can easily lead to less generalization of the model trained by a single user, and some data sharing may also cause privacy leakage. Then, this paper uses the method of federated reinforcement learning to solve this problem in order to insure privacy. Besides, considering the poor quality of local models, which leads to the poor versatility of the overall parameters, this paper proposes a federated reinforcement learning method based on Attention mechanism to aggregate the parameter weights, which makes the new model more generalized. The experimental results show that the federated reinforcement learning task offloading model with Attention mechanism can reduce the processing delay of the task.

AB Micro-UAV swarms usually generate massive data when performing tasks. These data can be harnessed with various machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve the swarm's intelligence. To achieve this goal while protecting swarm data privacy, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a promising enabling technology. During the model training process of FL, the UAV may face an energy scarcity issue due to the limited battery capacity. Fortunately, this issue is potential to be tackled via simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). However, the integration of SWIPT and FL brings new challenges to the system design that have yet to be addressed, which motivates our work. Specifically, in this paper, we consider a micro-UAV swarm network consisting of one base station (BS) and multiple UAVs, where the BS uses FL to train an ML model over the data collected by the swarm. During training, the BS broadcasts the model and energy simultaneously to the UAVs via SWIPT, and each UAV relies on its harvested and battery-stored energy to train the received model and then upload it to the BS for model aggregation. To improve the learning performance, we formulate a problem of maximizing the percentage of scheduled UAVs by jointly optimizing UAV scheduling and wireless resource allocation. The problem is a challenging mixed integer nonlinear programming problem and is NP-hard in general. By exploiting its special structure property, we develop two algorithms to achieve the optimal and suboptimal solutions, respectively. Numerical results show that the suboptimal algorithm achieves a near-optimal performance under various network setups, and significantly outperforms the existing representative baselines. considered.

AB The frequent occurrence of severe convective weather has certain adverse effects on the smart agriculture industry. To enhance the prediction of severe convective weather, the inversion model effectively fills radar reflectivity data gaps by leveraging geostationary satellite data, offering more comprehensive and accurate support for meteorological information in smart agriculture systems. Nevertheless, collaborative cross-regional inversion driven by dispersed radar data faces challenges in efficiency, privacy, and model accuracy. To this end, we employ an U-shaped residual network with an embedded light hybrid attention mechanism and utilize a federated averaging algorithm for efficient distributed training across multiple devices which could preserve the privacy of data from different locations, thereby improving inversion performance. In addition, to address the unbalanced nature of radar data, a weighted loss function is designed to enhance the model's sensitivity to high radar reflectivity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits a certain level of improvement in evaluating radar reflectivity inversion performance across different thresholds compared to other models, thus substantiating the superiority of the proposed approach.

AB The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emphasize synchronizing technology and routine life for sustainability. Food and water shortage, and exponentially increasing environmental pollution are the biggest challenges for sustainability. Livestock plays a vital role in developing countries' economies; the most profitable businesses are breeding dairy and non-dairy products. The productivity of cattle farms is dependent on the health conditions of cattle. Identifying unhealthy cattle and providing suitable treatment is critical. Hence, deploying the Internet of Things (IoT) along with AI systems is one of the potential solutions. This cattle health monitoring system provides monitoring of cattle health to ensure the minimum human intervention. A system has been designed and developed to aid the intelligent cattle health monitoring system by using machine learning techniques. The system includes multiple sensor nodes, each having a body area sensor that is connected to the IoT platform through a controller. As a novelty, the prototype has been trained and evaluated using a federated learning technique. The system warns the owner about specific diseases such as fever, mastitis, foot and mouth disease, and ketosis. The presented results validate the proposal as it diagnoses the prescribed viral diseases precisely. We have implemented the Gaussian Na & iuml;ve Bayes classifier for this multiclass problem. Considering the federated learning model, three different datasets are considered as three different clients with 70% train and 30% test data. Client 1, Client 2, and Client 3 represent the cattle farm, veterinary hospital, and veterinary respectively. The sensor nodes are placed on key points of the cattle body while each node collects physiological parameters that are further used to train the prediction system. Additionally, we have developed a user-friendly Android application for the owner to control cattle well-being. A comprehensive comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed system outperforms existing state-of-the-art systems by showing good accuracy.

TI A novel parameter decoupling approach of personalised federated learning

AB Given the importance of privacy protection in databases and other institutions, federated learning (FL) is used to benefit training machine learning models based on these decentralised and private data so as to address the growing vision tasks. However, for federated learning, statistical heterogeneity continues to be a major problem. Recently, plenty of personalised federated learning methods have been explored to solve the problem of statistical heterogeneity. The usage of trained base layers and the effect of feature extraction in personalised layers, however, are hardly considered in those methods that employ the learning personalised models approach. To address the problem of the statistical heterogeneity in image analysis, PCCFED, a personalised federated learning method utilizing the strategy of parameter decoupling is proposed. It should be emphasised that the authors' personalised federated learning method decouples the personalised (P) layers into a connecting (C) layer and classifier (C) layer in order to enhance the effectiveness of feature learning for personalised layers. Further, an approach is proposed to fully use the base layers to adapt a personalised model based on the newly admitted institution's dataset through meta-transfer. The performance of the proposed PCCFED on three datasets is evaluated under the practical non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with baseline methods, the proposed framework achieves the best performance in federated learning and fine-tuning. Through FL, the investigation reveals a method to reduce statistical heterogeneity while protecting the institutions' privacy.

TI Federated Learning on the Road Autonomous Controller Design for
   Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
LA English

DE Wireless networks; machine learning; control systems
ID OPTIMIZATION; COMMUNICATION
AB The deployment of future intelligent transportation systems is contingent upon seamless and reliable operation of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). One key challenge in developing CAVs is the design of an autonomous controller that can accurately execute near real-time control decisions, such as a quick acceleration when merging to a highway and frequent speed changes in a stop-and-go traffic. However, the use of conventional feedback controllers or traditional learning based controllers, solely trained by each CAV's local data, cannot guarantee a robust controller performance over a wide range of road conditions and traffic dynamics. In this paper, a new federated learning (FL) framework enabled by large-scale wireless connectivity is proposed for designing the autonomous controller of CAVs. In this framework, the learning models used by the controllers are collaboratively trained among a group of CAVs. To capture the varying CAV participation in the FL training process and the diverse local data quality among CAVs, a novel dynamic federated proximal (DFP) algorithm is proposed that accounts for the mobility of CAVs, the wireless fading channels, as well as the unbalanced and non-independent and identically distributed data across CAVs. A rigorous convergence analysis is performed for the proposed algorithm to identify how fast the CAVs converge to using the optimal autonomous controller.In particular, the impacts of varying CAV participation in the FL process and diverse CAV data quality on the convergence of the proposed DFP algorithm are explicitly analyzed. Leveraging this analysis, an incentive mechanism based on contract theory is designed to improve the FL convergence speed. Simulation results using real vehicular data traces show that the proposed DFP-based controller can accurately track the target CAV speed over time and under different traffic scenarios. Moreover, the results show that the proposed DFP algorithm has a much faster convergence compared to popular FL algorithms such as federated averaging (FedAvg) and federated proximal (FedProx). The results also validate the feasibility of the contract-theoretic incentive mechanism and show that the proposed mechanism can improve the convergence speed of the DFP algorithm by 40% compared to the baselines.

AB Federated Averaging (FedAvg) is the baseline Federated Learning (FL) algorithm that applies the stochastic gradient descent for local model training and the arithmetic averaging of the local models' parameters for global model aggregation. Succeeding FL works commonly utilize the arithmetic averaging scheme of FedAvg for the aggregation. However, such arithmetic averaging is prone to the outlier model-updates, especially when the clients' data are non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). As such, the classical aggregation approach suffers from the dominance of the outlier updates and, consequently, causes high communication costs towards producing a decent global model. In this letter, we propose a robust aggregation strategy to alleviate the above issues. In particular, we propose first pruning the node-wise outlier updates (weights) from the local trained models and then performing the aggregation on the selected effective weights-set at each node. We provide the theoretical result of our method and conduct extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Shakespeare datasets with IID and non-IID settings, which demonstrate that our aggregation approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of communication speedup, test-set performance and training convergence.

AB Federated continual learning (FCL) is emerging as a key technology for time-sensitive applications in highly adaptive environments including autonomous driving and industrial digital twin. Each FCL trains machine learning models using newly-generated datasets as soon as possible, to obtain a highly accurate machine learning model for new event predictions. The age of data, defined as the time difference between the generation time of a dataset and the current time, is widely adopted as a key criterion to evaluate both timeline and quality of training. In this paper, we study the problem of age-aware FCL in a mobile edge computing (MEC) network. We not only investigate optimization techniques that optimize the data selection and aggregator placement for FCL but also implement a real system as a prototype for age-aware FCL. Specifically, we first propose an approximation algorithm with a provable approximation ratio for the age-aware data selection and aggregator placement problem for FCL with a single request. In real application scenarios, there are usually multiple FCL requests that require to train models, and delays in the MEC network are usually uncertain. We then study the problem of age-aware data selection and aggregator placement problem for FCL with uncertain delays and multiple requests, by devising an online learning algorithm with a bounded regret based on contextual bandits. We finally implement a prototype for FCL in an MEC network, with various heterogeneous user equipments (UEs) and cloudlets with different computing capabilities in the network. Experiment results show that the performance of the proposed algorithms outperform existing studies, by achieving 47% lower age of data and 12% higher model accuracy.

AB A large amount of labeled data are important to enhance the performance of deep-learning-based methods in the area of fault diagnosis. Because it is difficult to obtain high-quality samples in real industrial applications, federated learning is an effective framework for solving the problem of sparse samples by using the distributed data. Its global model is updated by the local client without sharing data at each round. Considering computing resources and communication loss of multiple clients, an efficient method based on stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAEs) and Siamese networks is proposed to detect interturn short-circuit (ITSC) faults in permanent magnet synchronous motors. In this article, to achieve an accurate ITSC fault detection, an SSAE was employed to extract sparse features in a limited number of samples, and Siamese networks were used to determine the similarity between the given samples. The problem of fault diagnosis is transformed into a classification problem under few-shot learning. Furthermore, the proposed method is trained successfully in the frameworks of centralized learning and decentralized structure. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieved high fault diagnosis accuracy. Moreover, it is suitable for deployment in smart manufacturing systems.

ID MODEL
AB The intermittent integration of renewable energy sources and the enhancement of energy-saving awareness on the demand side have posed significant challenges to energy management in smart grids. To address the supply-demand imbalance issues caused by these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multiple time-scale dispatch model. The model utilizes demand response strategy for demand side management (DSM) and employs dynamic pricing strategy for supply -side management. Furthermore, an advanced approach based on federated learning and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic(TD3) policy gradient algorithm is proposed to construct a federated learning mechanism among multi agents. This approach performs distributed optimization on the multi-agent system to derive the optimal network weights for multiple stakeholders, resulting in the generation of an optimal dynamic pricing strategy that ensures the economic efficiency and secure operation of the smart grid. From the methodological perspective, this approach enhances privacy protection and decision-making autonomy for each stakeholder, while improving the optimization efficiency of the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Based on simulation results, it is evident that the proposed method facilitates economically efficient transactions between supply and demand, and the improved distributed multi-agent federated reinforcement learning (MAFRL) approach holds promise as a feasible and optimal optimization method for economic dispatch in smart grid.

ID ATTACKS
AB Federated learning, as a new security exchange paradigm, is widely used in medical care, driverless cars, finance, and other fields. However, federated learning still faces the problem of sybil attacks common in distributed frameworks. The existing schemes mainly defend against malicious model attacks with distance comparison, neural network, and confidence vote. But they are significantly limited in dealing with collusive sybil attacks. Therefore, we propose a federated learning malicious model detection method based on feature importance (Fed-Fi). Firstly, we screen important features by feature importance reasoning method based on LRP and compare the similarity based on Hamming distance between important features. Then, we adjust model learning rate adaptively to reduce the effect of collusive sybil attacks on the global model. The experimental results indicate that it can effectively resist the attack of collusive sybils in federated learning.

AB The increasing penetration of distributed renewable energy and electric vehicles (EV) in local microgrids/residential-community has brought a great challenge to balancing system stability and economic benefits. This paper proposes a decentralized framework based on an efficient federated deep reinforcement learning method for plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) fleet charging management in a residential community, which is equipped with a photovoltaic and battery energy storage system and connected to a local transformer. Firstly, the framework of PEV charging management is described as a virtual EV charging station coordinating charging tasks through sharing public information with distributed agents. Then, an individual preference model of PEV is developed considering heterogenous PEV charging anxiety, battery degradation, and collective penalty. Subsequently, we propose an attention-weighted federated soft-actor-critic method to efficiently seek the co-ordinational scheduling of the PEV fleet charging in a distributed way, where scalability and privacy protection can be ensured with attention-based information sharing. Finally, a real-world case study is conducted to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.

ID FRAUD
AB Nowadays, a lot of studies unite multiple organizations to form an anti-fraud alliance to detect fraudulent transactions better using federated boosting tree algorithms. However, there are two challenges when building the federated boosting tree-based fraud detection model. First, the vertical federated learning (VFL) framework is not enough for the transaction fraud detection task because there are various participants in the same field (e.g., different banks) who cannot share data with others freely. And a lot of local data would be discarded due to the private set intersection process under the VFL framework. Second, there are still many privacy threats that can infer the data sequence information of the participants. Once the attackers illegally obtain the data sequence information, they can infer the raw data of the victims based on the data distribution. Specially, the instance spaces and score lists would also be maliciously exploited to launch a new data sequence inference attack that is currently indefensible. In response to the above challenges, we first propose a sequence inference attack that is the first work showing the vulnerabilities regarding the instance spaces and score lists. Then, we propose a federated boosting tree-based fraud detection method against (A) sequence (S) inference (I) attacks (A), named ASIA. ASIA method can combine the horizontal federated learning (HFL) framework with the VFL framework to better detect fraudulent transactions while defending against sequence inference attacks. Finally, we evaluate SIS attack and ASIA method in experiments based on two public fraud detection datasets: European Credit Card (ECC) and IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection (Vesta). The experimental results show that the sequences of the participants are at a high risk of being leaked when suffering SIS attack. Moreover, compared with several widely used federated boosting tree methods, ASIA method can significantly improve privacy-preserving performance without sacrificing fraud detection accuracy.

AB Over the past few years, billions of unsecured Internet of Things (IoT) devices have been produced and released, and that number will only grow as wireless technology advances. As a result of their susceptibility to malware, effective methods have become necessary for identifying IoT malware. However, the low generalizability and the nonindependently and identically distributed data (non-IID) still pose a major challenge to achieving this goal. In this work, a new federated malware detection paradigm, termed FED-MAL, is introduced to collaboratively train multiple distributed edge devices to detect malware. In FED-MAL, the malware binaries are transformed into an image format to lessen the impact on non-IID, and then a compact convolutional model, named AM-NET, is proposed to learn the malware patterns as an image recognition task. The compact nature of AM-NET makes it an appropriate choice for deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices. Following, a refined edge-based adversarial training is given in FED-MAL to empower generalizability and resistibility by generating adversarial samples from various participating clients. Experimental evaluation on publicly available malware data sets shows that the FED-MAL is efficacious, reliable, expandable, generalizable, and communication efficient.

AB In some real-world applications, data samples are usually distributed on local devices, where federated learning (FL) techniques are proposed to coordinate decentralized clients without directly sharing users' private data. FL commonly follows the parameter server architecture and contains multiple personalization and aggregation procedures. The natural data heterogeneity across clients, i.e., Non-I.I.D. data, challenges both the aggregation and personalization goals in FL. In this paper, we focus on a special kind of Non-I.I.D. scene where clients own incomplete classes, i.e., each client can only access a partial set of the whole class set. The server aims to aggregate a complete classification model that could generalize to all classes, while the clients are inclined to improve the performance of distinguishing their observed classes. For better model aggregation, we point out that the standard softmax will encounter several problems caused by missing classes and propose "restricted softmax" as an alternative. For better model personalization, we point out that the hard-won personalized models are not well exploited and propose "inherited private model" to store the personalization experience. Our proposed algorithm named MAP could simultaneously achieve the aggregation and personalization goals in FL. Abundant experimental studies verify the superiorities of our algorithm.

AB Facing large-scale online learning, the reliance on sophisticated model architectures often leads to nonconvex distributed optimization, which is more challenging than convex problems. Online recruited workers, such as mobile phone, laptop, and desktop computers, often have narrower uplink bandwidths than downlink. In this article, we propose two communication-efficient nonconvex federated learning algorithms with error feedback 2021 (EF21) and lazily aggregated gradient (LAG) for adapting uplink and downlink communications. EF21 is a new and theoretically better EF, which consistently and substantially outperforms vanilla EF in practice. LAG is a gradient filtration technique for adapting communication. For reducing communication costs of uplink, we design an effective LAG rule and then give EF21 with LAG (EF-LAG) algorithm, which combines EF21 and our LAG rule. We also present a bidirectional EF-LAG (BiEF-LAG) algorithm for reducing uplink and downlink communication costs. Theoretically, our proposed algorithms enjoy the same fast convergence rate $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ as gradient descent (GD) for smooth nonconvex learning. That is, our algorithms greatly reduce communication costs without sacrificing the quality of learning. Numerical experiments on both synthetic data and deep learning benchmarks show significant empirical superiority of our algorithms in communication.

AB Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful privacy-preserving approach that enables multiple devices to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing raw data. To motivate client participation and protect against malicious threats such as poisoning attacks, it is necessary to design a fair trading platform with an incentive mechanism. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based FL framework and design a dynamic incentive mechanism to establish a decentralized and transparent trading platform. A reputation mechanism is employed to assess the reliability of participants, and blockchain technology is utilized to ensure secure and tamper-proof management. Additionally, we design a dynamic incentive mechanism based on reputation and Stackelberg game theory, where the task publisher, acting as the leader, determines the total reward, and the participants, as followers, decide their level of engagement. Participants are selected and rewarded based on their reputations and bids, within a constrained budget. Experimental results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework effectively promotes high-quality participants to engage in the training task. It prevents malicious participants from disrupting the training process, maintaining the high accuracy across different scenarios, even with 50% malicious participants.

AB An emergence of attention and regulations on consumer privacy can be observed over the recent years with the ubiquitous availability of IoT systems handling personal data. Federated Learning (FL) arises as a privacy-preserved Machine Learning (ML) technique where data can be kept private within these devices without transmitting to third parties. Yet, many privacy attacks against FL can still leak private and sensitive information. Though solutions are currently available, they may not fit into the scope of IoT devices and may lead to sub-optimal results for the FL process. To balance these trade-offs, we propose a consumer-first approach to privacy protection where local privacy preservation is done via a privacy recommendation system. To evaluate the level of vulnerability of the local FL models, we use existing attacks and propose a novel time-based inference attack to test the resilience of FL models. Based on the vulnerability assessment, privacy recommendations are applied to local FL models based on a new gradient-split mechanism that adds a perturbation mask to the updates. Our experiments demonstrate the attacks can be mitigated effectively via the proposed mechanisms, with enhanced privacy and minimum compromise to the FL model utility.

AB The emergence of integrated positioning, communication, and computing (IPC2) technology has paved the way for advanced capabilities in physical-digital spatial positioning, intelligent communication, and computing. This article delves into an in-depth exploration of a federated learning-assisted multidimensionality fusion IPC2 system. Within this system, edge nodes collaboratively harness their locally distributed multidimensionality positioning and communication data to coordinate edge computing resources for model training. Throughout the process of fully distributed collaborative training, we focus on addressing two specific security concerns: 1) data tampering and 2) model tampering attacks. In pursuit of bolstering the system's resilience against potential attacks, we introduce a novel federated-blockchain edge learning (FLBC) framework. This framework capitalizes on the inherent features of the blockchain, namely, its nontampering and traceability attributes. In addition, we present a meticulously designed verification algorithm tailored for the parameters aggregation process. Specifically, an aggregation algorithm is developed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the training model's fitting. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed approach, comprehensive simulations are conducted using an openly accessible wireless artificial intelligence (AI) data set. The outcomes of these simulations clearly demonstrate that the proposed scheme adeptly combats data tampering attacks initiated by multiple malicious nodes and high-intensity model tampering attacks, all while maintaining minimal accuracy loss.

AB Wireless-based federated learning (FL), as an emerging distributed learning approach, has been widely studied for 6G systems. When the paradigm shifts from terrestrial to non-terrestrial networks (NTN), FL may need to address several open challenges, e.g., the limited service time of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the straggler issue in synchronous FL, and time-efficient uploading and aggregation for massive devices. In this work, we exploit the synergy of LEO and FL for future integrated 6G-satellite systems by taking advantage of ubiquitous wireless access provided by LEO and appealing characteristics of collaborative training and data privacy preservation in FL. The studied LEO-FL framework may need to improve multi-metric performance in practice. Different from most FL works, we simultaneously improve the communication-training efficiency and local training accuracy from a multi-objective optimization (MOO) perspective. To solve the problem, we propose a decomposition and meta-deep reinforcement learning based MOO algorithm for FL (DMMA-FL), aiming at adapting to the dynamic satellite-terrestrial environments, achieving efficient uploading and aggregation, and approaching Pareto optimal sets. Compared to single-objective optimization, heuristics-based, and learning-based MOO algorithms, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed LEO-FL framework and DMMA-FL algorithm are assessed on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

AB Urban sensing is a rapidly growing field that involves gathering real-time data from urban environments. These smart sensing systems are pivotal in enhancing urban planning, resource management, and overall quality of life in cities. However, in the context of data collection and network congestion, nonnegligible latency can be experienced in urban environments. Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an attractive approach to address network latency concerns. FL achieves distributing data processing tasks in urban sensing by uploading training results rather than raw data to a central server. In light of this, our article proposes a wireless sensor air-ground integrated FL (AGIFL) network with covert communication. The AGIFL system utilizes a high-altitude platform (HAP) as a parameter server to provide mobility and sustainability of urban sensors and a friendly jammer unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to enhance information security. Our main objective is to minimize FL latency for the urban sensor network and ensure secure transmission. To achieve this, we jointly optimize the local training accuracy, interference power, and transmit power of FL sensors. To tackle the nonconvexity of the problem, we decompose the original nonconvex problem into subproblems and solve it using successive convex approximation (SCA) with alternating iterations. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces latency in urban sensor networks significantly and ensures the secure transmission of information compared to benchmarks.

AB Industrial internet of things (IIoT) is considered as large-scale IoT-based network comprising of sensors, communication channels, and security protocols used in Industry 4.0 for diverse real-time operations. Industrial IoT (IIoT) networks are vulnerable to diverse cyber threats and attacks. Attack detection is the biggest security issue in the IIoT. Various traditional attack detection methods are proposed by several researchers but all are insufficient to protect privacy and security. To address the issue, a novel Gradient Descent Scaling and Segmented Regression Fine-tuned Federated Learning (GDS-SRFFL) method is introduced for IIoT network attack detection. The aim of the GDS-SRFFL method is to enhance the security of an IIoT network. Initially, the novelty of Gradient Descent Scaling-based preprocessing is applied to the raw dataset for obtaining feature feature-scaled preprocessed network sample. Then, the unwanted intrusions are discovered by using a Segmented Regression Fine-tuned Mini-batch Federated Learning model to ensure the protection of IoT networks with the novelty of SoftMax Regression. In order to validate the proposed methodology, experimentations were conducted on different parameters, namely accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and attack detection time, and the results concluded that proposed GDS-SRFFL has improved accuracy by 10%, precision by 13%, recall by 10%, specificity by 11% as well as minimum attack detection time by 28% as compared to existing techniques like CNN + LSTM (Altunay and Albayrak in Eng Sci Technol Int J 38:101322, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jestch.2022.101322), Enhanced Deep and Ensemble learning in SCADA-based IIoT network (Khan et al. in IEEE Trans Ind Inf 19(1):1030-1038, https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2022.3190352), RNN (Ullah and Mahmoud in IEEE Access 10:62722-62750, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3176317), and other CNN methods. The proposed method "GDS-SRFFL" has overall accuracy of 89.42% as compared to other existing methods.

AB Federated learning-based network intrusion detection system (FL-based NIDS) has demonstrated tremendous potential in protecting the security of IoT network. It enables learning an effective intrusion detection model from massive traffic data collaboratively without data privacy leakage. However, FL-based NIDS has exhibited inherent vulnerabilities on the poisoning attacks launched by malicious clients. The poisoning attacks aim to corrupt the intrusion detection model and impair its protection capability, by injecting the poisoned traffic data into the local training dataset. We build a secure FL-based NIDS that is robust for the poisoning attacks, namely SecFedNIDS. Firstly, we propose the model-level defensive mechanism based on poisoned model detection. Specifically, we propose the gradient-based important model parameter selection method to provide the effective low-dimensional representations of the uploaded local model parameters, and then we propose the online unsupervised poisoned model detection method to identify the poisoned models and reject them to join in the global intrusion detection model. Subsequently, we design the data-level defensive mechanism based on poisoned data detection. Notably, we propose a novel poisoned data detection method based on class path similarity, to filter out the poisoned traffic data and avoid them participating in subsequent local training. We adopt layer-wise relevance propagation to extract the class path of clean traffic data, and transmit the class paths to the poisoned clients to help distinguish the poisoned traffic data. Results show that SecFedNIDS with the proposed model-level defense boosts the accuracy by up to 48% under the poisoning attacks on UNSW-NB15 dataset and 36% on CICIDS2018 dataset, and the proposed data-level defense further improves its accuracy by up to 13% on CICIDS2018 dataset.

TI A multi-objective approach for communication reduction in federated

AB Federated learning is a paradigm that proposes protecting data privacy by sharing local models instead of raw data during each iteration of model training. However, these models can be large, with many parameters, provoking a substantial communication cost and having a notable environmental impact. Reducing communication overhead is paramount but conflictual to maintaining the model's accuracy. Most research has dealt with the different factors influencing communication reduction separately without addressing their correlations. Moreover, most of them do not consider the heterogeneity of clients' hardware. Finding the optimal configuration to fulfil all these training aspects can become intractable for classical techniques. This work explores the add -in that multi -objective evolutionary algorithms can provide for solving the communication overhead problem while achieving high accuracy. We do this by 1) realistically modelling and formulating this task as a multi -objective problem by considering the devices' heterogeneity, 2) including all the communication -triggering aspects, and 3) applying a multi -objective evolutionary algorithm with an intensification operator to solve the problem. A simulated client-server architecture of four devices with four different processing speeds is studied. Both fully connected and convolutional neural network models are investigated with 33,400 and 887,530 weights, respectively. The experiments are performed using the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. A comparison is made between three approaches using an extensive set of metrics. Results prove that our approach obtains solutions with better accuracy than the full -communication setting and other methods while getting reductions in communications by around 1,000 times in most cases and up to 10,000 times in some cases compared to the maximum communication setting.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a new dawn of artificial intelligence (AI), in which machine learning models are constructed in a distributed manner while communicating only model parameters between a centralized aggregator and client internet-of-medical-things (IoMT) nodes. The performance of such a learning technique can be seriously hampered by the activities of a malicious jammer robot. In this paper, we study client selection and channel allocation along with the power control problem of the uplink FL process in IoMT domain under the presence of a jammer from the perspective of long-term learning duration. We map the interaction between the FL network and the jammer in each learning iteration as a Stackelberg game, in which the jammer acts as the leader and the FL network serves as the follower. We consider the client and channel selection as well as the power control jointly as the strategy of this game. Upon formulating the game, we find the joint best response strategy for both types of players by leveraging the difference of convex (DC) programming approach and the dual decomposition technique. Beside the availability of the complete information to both the players, we also study the problem from the perspective that the FL network knows the partial information of the other player. Extensive simulations have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the jamming game.

AB Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) has been introduced to improve the efficiency of FL by reducing the latency of Machine Learning (ML) model aggregation, particularly in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Meanwhile, decentralized FL, such as leveraging blockchain and directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based ledgers, also has drawn much attention to the integration of FL owing to the security benefit against single-point-failure and Byzantine fault tolerant consensus. We observe that the inherent network asynchrony of DAG-based ledgers is beneficial for implementing asynchronous FL particularly in edge computing domains, even though there is no existing survey work that provides a fundamental overview of such integration. This paper surveys on the integration of asynchronous FL with DAG, which we call AFL-DAG, as a promising approach to realize the intersection of decentralized FL and asynchronous FL. Motivated by the lack of a concrete taxonomy of asynchronous FL and a global model, especially with decentralized FL, we introduce universally applicable terminologies and the extensive classification method of FL in terms of asynchrony. Based on the proposed taxonomy, we present a generic system model of AFL-DAG for edge computing applications. To provide a horizontal overview and cover fundamental concepts in AFL-DAG, we identify four critical design factors and the state-of-the-art solutions are discussed accordingly. Future directions to achieve a practical AFL-DAG are also highlighted. Finally, we explore the opportunities of AFL-DAG by investigating a popular edge computing application, the on-device crowdsourcing, and provide a high-level evaluation of AFL-DAG compared to blockchained-FL.

ID AGGREGATION
AB Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for training machine learning models across decentralized devices while maintaining data privacy. In the healthcare domain, FL enables collaborative training among diverse medical devices and institutions, enhancing model robustness and generalizability without compromising patient privacy. In this paper, we propose DPS-GAT, a novel approach integrating graph attention networks (GATs) with differentially private client selection and resource allocation strategies in FL. Our methodology addresses the challenges of data heterogeneity and limited communication resources inherent in medical applications. By employing graph neural networks (GNNs), we effectively capture the relational structures among clients, optimizing the selection process and ensuring efficient resource distribution. Differential privacy mechanisms are incorporated, to safeguard sensitive information throughout the training process. Our extensive experiments, based on the Regensburg pediatric appendicitis open dataset, demonstrated the superiority of our approach, in terms of model accuracy, privacy preservation, and resource efficiency, compared to traditional FL methods. The ability of DPS-GAT to maintain a high and stable number of client selections across various rounds and differential privacy budgets has significant practical implications, indicating that FL systems can achieve strong privacy guarantees without compromising client engagement and model performance. This balance is essential for real-world applications where both privacy and performance are paramount. This study suggests a promising direction for more secure and efficient FL medical applications, which could improve patient care through enhanced predictive models and collaborative data utilization.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel federated deep unrolling method for increasing the accuracy of the Lidar Super resolution. The proposed framework not only offers notable improvements in Lidar-based SLAM methodologies but also provides a solution to the significant cost associated with high-resolution Lidar sensors. Particularly, our method can be adopted by a number of vehicles coordinated with a server towards learning a regularizer - a neural network - for capturing the dependencies of the Lidar data. To tackle this adaptive federated optimization problem effectively, we initially propose a deep unrolling framework, converting our solution into a well-justified deep learning architecture. The learnable parameters of this architecture are directly derived from the solution of the proposed optimization problem, thus resulting in an explainable architecture. Further, we extend the capabilities of our deep unrolling technique by incorporating a federated learning strategy. Our federated deep unrolling model employs an innovative Adapt-then-Combine strategy, where each vehicle optimizes its model and, subsequently, their learnable regularizers are combined to formulate a robust global regularizer, equipped to handle diverse environmental conditions. Through extensive numerical evaluations on real-world Lidar based SLAM applications, our proposed model demonstrates superior performance along with a significant reduction in trainable parameters, with 99.75% fewer parameters compared to state of the art lidar super-resolution deep neural networks. Essentially, this study is the first initiative to combine deep unrolling with federated learning, showcasing an efficient, and data-secure approach to automotive Lidar super-resolution SLAM applications.

AB While big data helps improve decision-making and model developments, it often runs into privacy concerns. An example would be retrieving drivers' origin and destination information from smartphone navigation apps for developing a route choice behavior model. To conserve privacy, yet to take advantage of big data in navigation applications, the authors propose to apply a federated learning approach, which has shown promising application in predicting smartphone keyboard's next word without sending text to the server. Additional benefits of using federated learning is to save on data communications, by sending model parameters instead of entire raw data, and to distribute the computational burden to each smartphone instead of to the main server. The results from real-world route navigation usage data from about 30,000 drivers over one year showed that the proposed federated learning approach was able to achieve very similar accuracy to the traditional centralized global model and yet assures privacy.

AB In recent years, deep learning models have shown their advantages in neuroimage analysis, such as brain disease diagnosis. Unfortunately, it is usually difficult to acquire numerous brain networks at a single centralized site to effectively train a high-quality deep learning model. To address this issue, federated learning (FL) has gained popularity in brain disease diagnosis, which allows deep learning models to be trained without centralizing data. However, most FL-based works might still face two following challenges. Firstly, the high -dimensional features of brain networks are often far larger than sample size, which might lead to poor performance due to the curse of dimensionality. Secondly, differences in data distributions across different sites can impact the communication efficiency and performance of FL models. To overcome these challenges, we design a novel FL framework for diagnosing brain disorders, named FedBrain. Firstly, FedBrain proposes data augmentation based on L1 regularization to select significant features shared by all clients. The domain alignment loss based on the maximum mean discrepancy criterion is introduced to minimize differences in the marginal and conditional distributions between local clients. Furthermore, FedBrain proposes a personalized predictor based on mixture of experts to adapt to different clients, using a global and private predictor as two experts. Eventually, FedBrain integrates the above modules with differential privacy and homomorphic encryption into a unified FL framework. Experimental results on the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness, which shows that FedBrain can reduce the communication burden of FL and achieve the highest average accuracy of 79% against other counterparts.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used to perform search and tracking tasks in military and civil fields. To perform these tasks autonomously, a swarm of multiple UAVs need to be endowed with intelligence through machine learning (ML). However, the traditional centralized ML cannot be directly applied in UAV networks, since it is challenging to transmit raw data with limited bandwidth and energy budget. As a distributed manner, federated learning (FL) is more suitable for UAV networks than traditional ML schemes in order to boost edge intelligence for UAVs. Considering the limited energy supply of UAVs, we study how to minimize UAVs' overall training energy consumption by jointly optimizing the local convergence threshold, local iterations, computation resource allocation, and bandwidth allocation, subject to the FL global accuracy guarantee and maximum training latency constraint. The formulated nonconvex mixed-integer programming problem is solved by a joint training and resource allocation optimization algorithm. In addition, we also study how to solve the problem considering fairness among different UAVs by changing the objective to minimizing the maximum energy consumption of UAVs, and extend the aforementioned approach to this problem. Our simulation results show that while satisfying both the training accuracy and latency constraints, the proposed algorithm can reduce more UAVs' overall training energy consumption and the maximum energy consumption in the UAV swarm than four baseline schemes.

AB The industrial internet of things (IIoT) uses connected devices and sensors to improve efficiency in industry, but increased reliance on these systems makes them prone to faults. To ensure the reliability of IIoT systems, robust fault detection is necessary, which can be provided by artificial intelligence (AI). The current state -of -the -art approach for AI in IIoT is mainly focused on centralized learning, which is inefficient due to its high communication cost. Federated learning (FL) addresses this limitation by enabling distributed training without exposing individual information. In order to provide secure and efficient FL for the IIoT environment, several research studies have investigated the use of blockchain networks. However, most of these studies ignore the processing time metric, which is crucial for IIoT networks. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient parameter aggregation technique that enhances trust, security, and privacy for IIoT. We use a lightweight smart contract deployed with a proof-of-authority (PoA)-based blockchain in combination with a Gaussian differential privacy mechanism. We evaluate our proposed system using a real bearing fault dataset and demonstrate that it is able to provide a secure aggregation process with an accuracy of 94.00% and a processing time of 1.54 s, which is suitable for the IIoT environment with a private blockchain network.

AB Federated learning (FL) has been extensively exploited in the training of machine learning models to preserve data privacy. In particular, wireless FL enables multiple clients to collaboratively train models by sharing model updates via wireless communication without exposing raw data. The state-of-the-art wireless FL advocates efficient aggregation of model updates from multiple clients by over-the-air computing. However, a significant deficiency of over-the-air aggregation lies in the infeasibility of TopK model compression given that top model updates cannot be aggregated directly before they are aligned according to their indices. In view of the fact that TopK can greatly accelerate FL, we design a novel wireless FL with voting based TopK algorithm, namely WFL-VTopK, so that top model updates can be aggregated by over-the-air computing directly. Specifically, there are two phases in WFL-VTopK. In Phase 1, clients vote their top model updates, based on which global top model updates can be efficiently identified. In Phase 2, clients formally upload global top model updates so that they can be directly aggregated by over-the-air computing. Furthermore, the convergence of WFL-VTopK is theoretically guaranteed under non-convex loss. Based on the convergence of WFL-VTopK, we optimize model utility subjecting to training time and energy constraints. To validate the superiority of WFL-VTopK, we extensively conduct experiments with real datasets under wireless communication. The experimental results demonstrate that WFL-VTopK can effectively aggregate models by only communicating 1%-2% top models updates, and hence significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. By significantly reducing the wireless communication traffic, our work paves the road to train large models in wireless FL.

AB Accurate prediction of bearing remaining useful life (RUL) is essential for machine health management. In existing data-driven prognostic methods, centralized data resources and deep neural networks (DNNs) are two requisites. However, conventional data aggregation may result in the privacy disclosure of equipment. Meanwhile, most DNN-based RUL predictors are overparameterized, making them hard to be deployed on edge devices. To deal with these shortcomings, a new bearing RUL prediction method based on the federated learning (FL) and Taylor-expansion network pruning, namely, RUL-FLTNP, is proposed in this article. In this method, a central server and multiple clients work together to train an RUL predictor. First, a multiscale convolutional neural network with a longish full connection in the first layer (LFMCNN) is designed as the RUL predictor. Specifically, LFMCNN contains three units, multiscale feature augmentation module (MFAM), deep feature extraction module (DFEM), and prediction module (PM), where the MFAM is used to extend shallow features from the data stored in each client. Next, the text Taylor-expansion pruning criterion is applied to the DFEM to delete unimportant network nodes, after which each client utilizes its local data to recover the pruned model. The server aggregates all rebirth models to a new global model using the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm. Network pruning and rebirth occur alternately in the model training process to produce a compact structure. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method provides a promising solution to prognostic problems in data privacy-preserving scenarios.

AB Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) can improve the accuracy of local models and provide enhanced edge intelligence without exposing the raw data in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). However, in the MEC environment with constrained communication resources, transmitting the entire model between the server and the clients in traditional pFL methods imposes substantial communication overhead, which can lead to inaccurate personalization and degraded performance of mobile clients. In response, we propose a Communication-Efficient pFL architecture to enhance the performance of personalized models while minimizing communication overhead in MEC. First, a Knowledge-Aware Parameter Coaching method (KAPC) is presented to produce a more accurate personalized model by utilizing the layer-wise parameters of other clients with adaptive aggregation weights. Then, convergence analysis of the proposed KAPC is developed in both the convex and non-convex settings. Second, a Bidirectional Layer Selection algorithm (BLS) based on self-relationship and generalization error is proposed to select the most informative layers for transmission, which reduces communication costs. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed KAPC achieves superior accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, while the proposed BLS substantially improves resource utilization without sacrificing performance.

DE Suker-rod pumping systems; Federated learning; Class imbalance data;
   Decentralized fault diagnosis
AB The development of modern oilfields has entered the middle and late stages, transforming towards digitalization and intelligence. However, the distribution of the sucker-rod pumping systems is decentralized, and the working condition information is skew-distributed. This situation poses a significant challenge to existing centralized fault diagnosis mechanisms. To address the existing practical challenge in the oilfield, a federated learning-based fault diagnosis framework for class imbalance in decentralized sucker-rod pumping systems (FL- CI) is proposed. This framework incorporates a parameter anonymization-ratio upload mechanism to mitigate the risk of gradient tracking. Then, a monitoring mechanism is leveraged to reversely infer global class- imbalance data using trained parameters uploaded by the clients. In addition, a ratio loss function is designed to calibrate the influence of class imbalance on the global system. After conducting comparative analysis, ablation analysis, and sensitivity analysis on a rod-pumping unit dataset (RPUD), as well as comparative and ablation analyses on the Case Western Reserve University bearing dataset (CWRU), the experimental results demonstrate that the FL-CI framework achieves superior diagnostic performance on the RPUD, with eight out of twelve evaluation metrics significantly outperforming seven state-of-the-art methods. A similar trend is observed on the CWRU, further validating the effectiveness and generalizability of the FL-CI.

TI Core network traffic prediction based on vertical federated learning and
   split learning
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Wireless traffic prediction is vital for intelligent cellular network operations, such as load-aware resource management and predictive control. Traditional centralized training addresses this but poses issues like excessive data transmission, disregarding delays, and user privacy. Traditional federated learning methods can meet the requirement of jointly training models while protecting the privacy of all parties' data. However, challenges arise when the local data features among participating parties exhibit inconsistency, making the training process difficult to sustain. Our study introduces an innovative framework for wireless traffic prediction based on split learning (SL) and vertical federated learning. Multiple edge clients collaboratively train high-quality prediction models by utilizing diverse traffic data while maintaining the confidentiality of raw data locally. Each participant individually trains dimension-specific prediction models with their respective data, and the outcomes are aggregated through collaboration. A partially global model is formed and shared among clients to address statistical heterogeneity in distributed machine learning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate our method's superiority over current approaches, showcasing its potential for network traffic prediction and accurate forecasting.

AB With the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the field of transportation, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) turned to be a vital method for designing Smart Transportation Systems (STS). STS consist of various interconnected vehicles and transportation infrastructure exposed to cyber intrusion due to the broad usage of software and the initiation of wireless interfaces. This study proposes a federated deep learning-based intrusion detection framework (FED-IDS) to efficiently detect attacks by offloading the learning process from servers to distributed vehicular edge nodes. FED-IDS introduces a context-aware transformer network to learn spatial-temporal representations of vehicular traffic flows necessary for classifying different categories of attacks. Blockchain-managed federated training is presented to enable multiple edge nodes to offer secure, distributed, and reliable training without the need for centralized authority. In the blockchain, miners confirm the distributed local updates from participating vehicles to stop unreliable updates from being deposited on the blockchain. The experiments on two public datasets (i.e., Car-Hacking, TON_IoT) demonstrated the efficiency of FED-IDS against state-of-the-art approaches. It reveals the credibility of securing networks of intelligent transportation systems against cyber-attacks.

AB Modern Healthcare cyberphysical systems have begun to rely more and more on distributed AI leveraging the power of Federated Learning (FL). Its ability to train Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for the wide variety of medical fields, while at the same time fortifying the privacy of the sensitive information that are present in the medical sector, makes the FL technology a necessary tool in modern health and medical systems. Unfortunately, due to the polymorphy of distributed data and the shortcomings of distributed learning, the local training of Federated models sometimes proves inadequate and thus negatively imposes the federated learning optimization process and in extend in the subsequent performance of the rest Federated models. Badly trained models can cause dire implications in the healthcare field due to their critical nature. This work strives to solve this problem by applying a post-processing pipeline to models used by FL. In particular, the proposed work ranks the model by finding how fair they are by discovering and inspecting micro-Manifolds that cluster each neural model's latent knowledge. The produced work applies a completely unsupervised both model and data agnostic methodology that can be leveraged for general model fairness discovery. The proposed methodology is tested against a variety of benchmark DL architectures and in the FL environment, showing an average 8.75% increase in Federated model accuracy in comparison with similar work.

AB Our study recognized the crucial role of early diagnosis of pulmonary radiological abnormalities such as pneumothorax, effusion, pneumonia, cardiomegaly, and COVID-19. We proposed FedXNet, which is a collaborative deep learning model based on federated learning (FL) exploiting edge computing resources efficiently to accurately deal with them and ensure privacy. Our developed model is notable for its integration of Multi-Headed Self-Attention, a complex technique that allows the model to focus on several parts of the input data at once. This improves the model's capacity to uncover complex patterns and correlations within the medical images. This multi-class CNN system uses a thorough four-pronged approach: (1) facilitating cross-institutional, federated training without sacrificing the integrity of individual data, (2) image preprocessing to achieve robust model accuracy, (3) efficient Feature extraction using pre-trained models and our dedicated FedXNet architecture, as well as (4) a variety of classifiers tailored to each disease, resulting in impressive diagnostic performance for a range of thoracic diseases, including COVID-19. This model paves the way for a future where timely diagnosis and better patient outcomes become a reality, empowered by the collaborative spirit of FL exploiting edge computing resources of IoT for implementing robust deep learning models.

AB The multi-energy system (MES), which is regarded as an optimum solution to a high-efficiency, green energy system and a crucial shift towards the future low-carbon energy system, has attracted great attention at the district building level. However, the current exploration of flexible MES operation has been hampered by (1) the increasing penetration of renewable energies and the complicated operation of coupling multi-energy sectors; (2) the privacy concern in the decentralization of the energy system; and (3) the lack of integration of the energy market and carbon emission trading scheme. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes a joint peer-to-peer energy and carbon allowance trading mechanism for a building community, and then models it as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) paradigm. In this setting, the flexibility of building local trading and the decarbonization of building energy management can both be fully utilized. To stabilize the training performance, an abstract critic network capturing system dynamics is introduced based on a deep deterministic policy gradient method. The technique of federated learning (FL) is also applied to speed up the training and safeguard the private information of each building in the community. Empirical results on a real-world test case evaluate its superior performance in terms of achieving both economic and environmental benefits, resulting in 5.87% and 8.02% lower total energy and environment costs than the two baseline mechanisms of peer-to-grid energy trading and peer-to-peer energy trading, respectively.

ID QUALITY PREDICTION
AB Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) aims to solve data sparsity and cold-start problems by utilizing a relatively information-rich source domain to improve the recommendation performance of the data-sparse target domain. However, most existing approaches rely on the assumption of centralized storage of user data, which undoubtedly poses a significant risk of user privacy leakage because user data are highly privacy-sensitive. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving Federated framework for Cross-Domain Recommendation, called FedCDR. In our method, to avoid leakage of user privacy, a general recommendation model is trained on each user's personal device to obtain embed -dings of users and items, and each client uploads weights to the central server. The central server then aggregates the weights and distributes them to each client for updating. Furthermore, because the weights implicitly contain private information about the user, local differential privacy is adopted for the gradients before uploading them to the server for better protection of user privacy. To distill the relationship of user embedding between two domains, an embedding transformation mechanism is used on the server side to learn the cross-domain embedding transformation model. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable with that of existing data-centralized methods and effectively protects user privacy.

AB With the evolution of fifth generation (5G) of mobile communication, vehicular edge computing (VEC) and moving small cell (MSC) network are gaining attention because of their capability to provide improved qualityof -service (QoS) to vehicular users. The ultimate goal of VEC-enabled MSC network is to diminish the vehicular penetration effect and path loss resulting in improved network performance for vehicular users. In this paper, we explore distributed resource block (RB) allocation for fronthaul links of MSCs with probabilistic mobility in VEC-enabled MSC network. The proposed work exploits the computational power of road side units (RSUs) deployed with VEC servers present along the road sides to allocate the resources to MSCs in a distributed manner by exchanging limited information, with the objective of maximizing the data rate achieved by MSC network. Moreover, we propose federated learning (FL) -based position prediction of MSCs to predict the trajectory of MSCs in advance for efficient prediction of resource allocation in MSC network. Simulations results are presented to compare the position prediction dependent distributed and centralized time interval dependent interference graph -based resource allocation to MSCs in terms of RB utilization and average achievable data rate of MSC network. For comparison, we further investigated centralized as well as distributed threshold time dependent interference graph -based allocation of resources to MSC network.

AB Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a globally shared model by employing local data samples generated by data sources. The inherent heterogeneity of IoT environments, in terms of hardware, network technology, network condition, and power supply, imposes challenges to original FL associated with model convergence speed, model accuracy, balanced training, and communica-tion costs. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical FL (HFL) framework based on semi -synchronous communications to address heterogeneity issues of original FL in intelligent IoT Edge environments. In particular, the proposed approach runs the aggregation process of local models in a hierarchal manner to generate a global model and uses semi-synchronous commu-nications to reduce communication costs. Moreover, a weighted aggregation method is intro-duced to overcome the unbalanced training problem of original FL in heterogeneous environments. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we implement a het-erogeneous IoT use case related to anomaly detection in a milling machining and design a prediction-based anomaly detection method based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is trained based on proposed Semi-synchronous HFL (SHFL). The results of implementa-tions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to fully synchronous and fully asynchronous FL approaches.

TI Mitigating Poor Data Quality Impact with Federated Unlearning for

AB Federated Learning (FL), which has been employed to train machine learning models on the data with a distributed manner, could enhance the immersive user experience for the human-centric metaverse. However, it's challenging to train machine learning models accurately and promptly with FL for the human-centric metaverse due to massive data communication and user unreliability. User experience could be negatively affected by using low-quality machine learning models for human-centric metaverse, e.g., it cannot scrutinize and arrive at decisions accurately and timely. To resolve this pressing issue, we propose MetaFul a federated unlearning solution which reduces the negative influences of low-quality data with no data transmission by removing low-quality training models at the server side. To be specific, MetaFul includes three main components. (i) Low-throughput federated learning (LT-FL) addresses the issue of large model transmission in FL by decreasing the dimension and the number of transmitted model parameters. (ii) Loss-based model quality assessment (LM-QA) utilizes the model loss generated in LT-FL to estimate user data quality. (iii) Non-communicative federated unlearning (NC-FUL) revokes the low-quality data impact on the FL model with careful designed federated unlearning at the server side. Both LM-QA and NC-FUL have no communications with clients. Finally, extensive evaluations are conducted to show MetaFul could improve the model accuracy by at least 2.5% and decrease the user perception time by at least 19.3% in human-centric metaverse compared to benchmarks.

AB Federated learning is an emerging technology that enables multiple clients to cooperatively train an intelligent diagnostic model while preserving data privacy. However, federated diagnostic models still suffer from a performance drop when applied to entirely unseen clients outside the federation in practical deployments. To address this issue, a Federated Distillation Domain Generalization (FDDG) framework is proposed for machinery fault diagnosis. The core idea is to enable individual clients to access multi-client data distributions in a privacypreserving manner and further explore domain invariance to enhance model generalization. A novel diagnostic knowledge-sharing mechanism is designed based on knowledge distillation, which equips multiple generators to augment fake data during the training of local models. Based on generated data and real data, a low-rank decomposition method is utilized to mine domain invariance, enhancing the model's ability to resist domain shift. Extensive experiments on two rotating machines demonstrate that the proposed FDDG achieves a 3% improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

AB Enhanced by machine learning (ML) techniques, data-driven dynamic security assessment (DSA) in smart cyber-physical grids has attracted significant research interest in recent years. However, the current centralized ML architectures have limited scalability, are vulnerable to privacy exposure, and are costly to manage. To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel effective and secure distributed DSA method based on horizontal federated learning (HFL) and differential privacy (DP), namely EFedDSA. It leverages local system operating data to predict and estimate the system stability status and optimize the power systems in a decentralized fashion. In order to preserve the privacy of the distributed DSA operating data, EFedDSA incorporates Gaussian mechanism into DP. To reduce the computational burden from multiple transmission communication rounds, a discounting method for the total communication round is proposed to reduce the total transmission rounds. Theoretical analysis on the Gaussian mechanism of EFedDSA provides formal DP guarantees. Extensive experiments conducted on the New England 10-machine 39-bus testing system and the synthetic Illinois 49-machine 200-bus testing system demonstrate that the proposed EFedDSA method can achieve advantageous DSA performance with fewer communication rounds, while protecting the privacy of the local model information compared to the state of the art.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a promising technique for collaboratively training machine-learning models on massively distributed clients data under privacy constraints. However, the existing FL literature focuses on speeding up the learning process and ignores minimizing the communication cost which is critical for resource-constrained clients. To this end, in this article, we propose a novel 3-way hierarchical framework (THF) to promote communication efficiency in FL. Using the proposed framework, only a cluster head (CH) communicates with the cloud server through edge aggregation in order to minimize the communication cost of clients. In particular, the clients upload their local models to their respective CHs, which are responsible to forward them to the corresponding edge server. The edge server averages the local models and iterates until it achieves the edge accuracy. Afterward, each edge server uploads the edge models to the cloud server for global aggregation. In this way, model downloading and uploading requires less bandwidth due to the short distance from source to destination that makes an efficient 3-way hierarchical network structure. In addition, we formulate a joint communication and computation resource management scheme through efficient client selection in order to achieve global cost minimization in FL. We conduct extensive empirical evaluations on diverse data learning tasks on multiple data sets to signify that THF achieves global cost savings and converges within fewer communication rounds compared to other FL approaches.

TI FedGTA: Topology-aware Averaging for Federated Graph Learning
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative training on large-scale subgraphs across multiple local systems. Existing FGL studies fall into two categories: (i) FGL Optimization, which improves multiclient training in existing machine learning models; (ii) FGL Model, which enhances performance with complex local models and multiclient interactions. However, most FGL optimization strategies are designed specifically for the computer vision domain and ignore graph structure, presenting dissatisfied performance and slow convergence. Meanwhile, complex local model architectures in FGL Models studies lack scalability for handling large-scale subgraphs and have deployment limitations. To address these issues, we propose Federated Graph Topology-aware Aggregation (FedGTA), a personalized optimization strategy that optimizes through topologyaware local smoothing confidence and mixed neighbor features. During experiments, we deploy FedGTAin 12 multi-scale real-world datasets with the Louvain and Metis split. This allows us to evaluate the performance and robustness of FedGTA across a range of scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedGTA achieves state-of-the-art performance while exhibiting high scalability and efficiency. The experiment includes ogbn-papers100M, the most representative large-scale graph database so that we can verify the applicability of our method to large-scale graph learning. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to bridge large-scale graph learning with FGL using this optimization strategy, contributing to the development of efficient and scalable FGL methods.

AB Recently, innovations in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), information and communication technologies, and machine learning (ML) have enabled smart healthcare. Pooling medical data into a centralized storage system to train a robust ML model, on the other hand, poses privacy, ownership, and regulatory challenges. Federated learning (FL) overcomes the prior problems with a centralized aggregator server and a shared global model. However, there are two technical challenges: 1) FL members need to be motivated to contribute their time and effort and 2) the centralized FL server may not accurately aggregate the global model. Therefore, combining the blockchain and FL can overcome these issues and provide high-level security and privacy for smart healthcare in a decentralized fashion. This study integrates two emerging technologies, blockchain and FL, for healthcare. We describe how blockchain-based FL plays a fundamental role in improving competent healthcare, where edge nodes manage the blockchain to avoid a single point of failure, while IoMT devices employ FL to use dispersed clinical data fully. We discuss the benefits and limitations of combining both technologies based on a content analysis approach. We emphasize three main research streams based on a systematic analysis of blockchain-empowered: 1) IoMT; 2) electronic health records (EHRs) and electronic medical records (EMRs) management; and 3) digital healthcare systems (internal consortium/secure alerting). In addition, we present a novel conceptual framework of blockchain-enabled FL for the digital healthcare environment. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of combining blockchain and FL for healthcare applications.

To solve the formulated problem, we propose a federated learning and deep Q-network (DQN) based cooperative resource allocation (FD-CRA) algorithm. The proposed FD-CRA algorithm uses a couple of DQNs at each edge node to perform spectrum resource pre-allocation, and offloading node selection and computing resource pre-allocation, respectively, for each user's service request. Meanwhile, it uses horizontal federated learning as the basic framework to consistently update all DQNs at each edge node. Simulation results show that the FD-CRA algorithm can significantly improve the successful processing ratio of users' service requests while meeting users' delay requirements.

AB The exponential proliferation of wearable medical apparatus and healthcare information within the framework of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) introduces supplementary complexities pertaining to the elevated Quality of Service (QoS) of intelligent healthcare in the forthcoming 6G era. Healthcare services and applications need ultra-reliable data transfer and processing with ultra-low latency and energy usage. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technologies enabled IoMT to handle large amounts of data sensing, transmission, and processing while maintaining good QoS. Traditional frame aggregation (FA) systems in WBAN, on the other hand, create an excessive number of control frames during data transmission, resulting in significant latency and energy consumption, as well as a lack of flexibility. A Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) based TO Approach is recommended in this research. In the beginning, different types of service-related information were separated into queues with equal QoS needs. The duration of the FA was then automatically determined by the aggregation vertex based on energy consumption, latency, and throughput using FRL. Finally, based on the existing status, the amount of tasks offloaded was determined. The simulation results demonstrate that, as compared to the baseline schemes, the suggested FRLTO efficiently reduces energy consumption and latency while enhancing throughput and total WBAN utilization. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme improves the throughput by 37.06% and reduced the energy consumption by around 69.84% and time delay by about 6.23%, as compared to the state-of-the-art existing baseline schemes.

AB Classical edge computing algorithms assume that the execution time is always known in resource allocation. However, in practice, the execution time in the edge server is hard to estimate due to the complex environment, especially in Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which makes resource allocation a significant challenge. To address this problem, we propose an optimal resource allocation approach based on Federated Learning (FL). In our proposed approach, we consider both the delay and energy consumption. First, we assume that we have perfect knowledge about the execution time in the edge server, and we obtain the optimal CPU cycles which should be assigned to process 1-bit task. We also verify the Poisson property of the task arrival for each server pool in the edge server. Since we use Delay Energy Product (DEP) as our optimization target for resource allocation, we can derive the optimal balanced delay and energy performance in the scheduling. Next, we propose the Federated Learning based method to estimate the execution time in the edge server. Simulation results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

   multicenter modeling; federated learning
AB Background: Multicenter medical research is becoming a new trend. However, interagency data privacy security protection has become a major bottleneck of multicenter research. Therefore, to overcome this privacy protection issue, the aim of the present study was to apply a self-developed privacy-preserving machine learning framework for researchers who can build models on medical data from multiple sources, while providing privacy protection for both sensitive data and the learned model.
   Methods: Based on Arya, a novel privacy computing platform developed by Healink, we constructed a privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) model using the fully connected neural network with datasets from 2-3 individual medical institutions. In the dataset, 80% of records were used for joint modeling on acute myocardial infarction ( AMI) diagnosis. Modeling efficacy was evaluated with the remaining 20% of records. As the control, 1,500 medical records from 1 medical institution were used for single-center modeling and efficacy evaluation. During the process, the original data were still kept in individual hospital without moving or transferring out of the hospitial. The diagnostic efficacy (sensitivity, positive predictive value, and accuracy) was evaluated.
   Results: Our privacy-preserving FL model gives reliable AMI diagnostic efficacy. Three-center modeling (79% sensitivity, 88% positive predictive value, and 82.3% accuracy) and two-center modeling (77.8% or 77.6% sensitivity, 86.7% or 85.30% positive predictive value, and 81% or 79.7% accuracy) achieved relative high diagnostic efficacy; and single-center modeling achieved relative low diagnostic efficacy (76% sensitivity, 84.7% positive predictive value, and 79% accuracy).
   Conclusions: The Arya privacy computing platform is efficient and practical for the FL model, which could promote multicenter medical research securely without sacrificing diagnostic efficacy.

AB As part of vehicle to everything (V2X) environments, intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) generate a large amount of data, which can be exploited securely and effectively through decentralized techniques such as federated learning (FL). Existing FL systems, however, are vulnerable to attacks and barely meet the security requirements for real-world applications. If malicious or compromised ICVs upload inaccurate or low-quality local model updates to the central aggregator, they may reduce the accuracy of the global model, thereby reducing drivers safety and efficiency. This paper aims to alleviate these concerns by presenting BV-ICVs, a blockchain-enabled and privacy-preserving FL framework for ICVs in an edge envisioned V2X environment. This system uses Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zkSNARKs) verification that is compiled as smart contracts to prevent malicious, compromised or even rational ICVs from uploading unreliable, erroneous or low-quality model updates. The verification process is embedded within the consensus of the underlying permissioned blockchain, which maximizes both the efficiency of the process and the utilization of computer resources. As demonstrated by discussions, security analysis, and numerical results, BV-ICVs reduced data poisoning attacks and increased the privacy protection and accuracy of FL.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB Real-time environment monitoring is a key application in Industrial Internet of Things, where sensors proactively collect and transmit environmental data to the controller. However, due to limited wireless resources, keeping sensors' sampled data fresh at the controller is critical. This work aims to investigate the trade-off between the sensor's data-sampling frequency and long-term data transmission energy consumption while maintaining information freshness. Leveraging the entropic risk measure (ERM), we jointly minimize the global transmission energy's mean and variance subject to probabilistic constraints on information freshness. Furthermore, while jointly saving the model training energy, we adopt the federated learning (FL) paradigm and propose an FL-based two-stage iterative optimization framework to optimize the aforementioned objective. Specifically, we iteratively learn the sampling frequency via Bayesian optimization and minimize the long-term ERM of the global energy consumption via Lyapunov optimization. Numerical results show that the proposed FL-based scheme saves substantial executing energy with less performance loss. Quantitatively, compared with the centralized learning baseline, the proposed FL-based framework saves up to 69% model training energy at the expense of a mere increased objective outcome, i.e., 6.3% in the global data transmission energy consumption (9.936x10(-5) in ERM) under 0.4% bias from the global optimal data-sampling frequency.

TI Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Framework with General Aggregation
   and Multiparty Entity Matching
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
AB The requirement for data sharing and privacy has brought increasing attention to federated learning. However, the existing aggregation models are too specialized and deal less with users' withdrawal issue. Moreover, protocols for multiparty entity matching are rarely covered. Thus, there is no systematic framework to perform federated learning tasks. In this paper, we systematically propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework (PFLF) where we first construct a general secure aggregation model in federated learning scenarios by combining the Shamir secret sharing with homomorphic cryptography to ensure that the aggregated value can be decrypted correctly only when the number of participants is greater than t. Furthermore, we propose a multiparty entity matching protocol by employing secure multiparty computing to solve the entity alignment problems and a logistic regression algorithm to achieve privacy-preserving model training and support the withdrawal of users in vertical federated learning (VFL) scenarios. Finally, the security analyses prove that PFLF preserves the data privacy in the honest-but-curious model, and the experimental evaluations show PFLF attains consistent accuracy with the original model and demonstrates the practical feasibility.

AB BackgroundInterest in Human Action Recognition (HAR), which encompasses both household and industrial settings, is growing. HAR describes a computer system's capacity to accurately recognize and evaluate human activities and behaviors, akin to what humans call perception. Real-time federated activity identification architecture is suggested in this work to monitor smartphone user behavior. The main aim is to decrease accidents happening in an indoor environment and assure the security of older individuals in an indoor setting. The idea lends itself to a multitude of uses, including monitoring the elderly, entertainment, and spying.ResultsIn this paper, we present a new smartphone sensor-based human motion awareness federated recognition scheme using a temporal-spatial weighted BILSTM-CNN framework. We verify new federated recognition based on temporal-spatial data better than existing machine learning schemes in terms of activity recognition accuracy. Several methods and strategies in the literature have been used to attain higher HAR accuracy. In particular, six categories of typical everyday human activities are highlighted, including walking, jumping, standing, moving from one level to another, and picking up items.ConclusionSmartphone-based sensors are utilized to detect the motion activities carried out by elderly people based on the raw inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. Then, weighted bidirectional long short-term memory (BILSTM) networks are for learning about temporal motion features; they are swiftly followed by single-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are built for reasoning about spatial structure features. Additionally, the awareness mechanism highlights the data segments to choose discriminative contextual data. Finally, a sizeable dataset of HDL activity datasets is gathered for model validation and training. The results confirm that the proposed ML framework performs 18.7% better in terms of accuracy, 27.9% for the case of precision, and 0.24.1% when evaluating based on the F1-score for client 1.Similarly, for client 2 and client 3, the performance betterment in terms of accuracy is 18.4% and 10.1%, respectively.

AB Vehicle speed prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation systems, promoting more reliable autonomous driving by accurately predicting future vehicle conditions. Due to variations in drivers' driving styles and vehicle types, speed predictions for different target vehicles may significantly differ. Existing methods may not realize personalized vehicle speed prediction while protecting drivers' data privacy. We propose a Federated learning framework with Personalized Aggregation Weights (FedPAW) to overcome these challenges. This method captures client-specific information by measuring the weighted mean squared error between the parameters of local models and global models. The server sends tailored aggregated models to clients instead of a single global model, without incurring additional computational and communication overhead for clients. To evaluate the effectiveness of FedPAW, we collected driving data in urban scenarios using the autonomous driving simulator CARLA, employing an LSTM-based Seq2Seq model with a multi-head attention mechanism to predict the future speed of target vehicles. The results demonstrate that our proposed FedPAW ranks lowest in prediction error within the time horizon of 10 seconds, with a 0.8% reduction in test MAE, compared to eleven representative benchmark baselines.

AB There is a growing interest in the distributed optimization framework that goes under the name of Federated Learning (FL). In particular, much attention is being turned to FL scenarios where the network is strongly heterogeneous in terms of communication resources (e.g., bandwidth) and data distribution. In these cases, communication between local machines (agents) and the central server (Master) is a main consideration. In this work, we present SHED, an original communicationconstrained Newton-type (NT) algorithm designed to accelerate FL in such scenarios. SHED is by design robust to non independent identically distributed (non i.i.d.) data distributions, handles heterogeneity of agents' communication resources (CRs), only requires sporadic Hessian computations, and achieves global asymptotic super-linear convergence. This is possible thanks to an incremental strategy, based on eigendecomposition of the local Hessian matrices, which exploits (possibly) outdated secondorder information. SHED is thoroughly validated on real datasets by assessing (i) the number of communication rounds required for convergence, (ii) the overall amount of data transmitted and (iii) the number of local Hessian computations. For all these metrics, SHED shows superior performance against state-of-the art techniques like BFGS, GIANT and FedNL. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID MUTUAL INFORMATION
AB Vertical federated feature selection can select effective features and avoid overfitting in vertical federated learning. However, existing privacy-preserving techniques for vertical federated feature selection are limited to selecting task-related features and cannot reduce redundant features among clients, resulting in performance loss. This article introduces a mutual information-based federated feature selection (MUSE) framework to address these issues. In the MUSE framework, the correlation of cross-device feature-feature and feature-class is estimated by our defined privacy-preserving mutual information, called federated mutual information (FMI). To compute FMI, we propose the anonymous bin matching (ABM) algorithm, which only uses the intersection size of bins rather than bin elements to avoid sample-IDs leakage. With FMI, MUSE can support the minimized dependency feature selection criteria for removing redundant features. Additionally, we propose the local feature preselection to reduce the computation cost of FMI. It is theoretically and experimentally proved as a close approximation of the global optimum under certain constraints. We evaluate the effectiveness of our MUSE framework on various datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform the state-of-the-art federated feature selection methods across most datasets. Moreover, our method shows potential in multimodal data as well.

AB We consider a broadband over-the-air computation empowered model aggregation approach for wireless federated learning (FL) systems and propose to leverage an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to combat wireless fading and noise. We first investigate the conventional node-selection based framework, where a few edge nodes are dropped in model aggregation to control the aggregation error. We analyze the performance of this node-selection based framework and derive an upper bound on its performance loss, which is shown to be related to the selected edge nodes. Then, we seek to minimize the mean-squared error (MSE) between the desired global gradient parameters and the actually received ones by optimizing the selected edge nodes, their transmit equalization coefficients, the IRS phase shifts, and the receive factors of the cloud server. By resorting to the matrix lifting technique and difference-of-convex programming, we successfully transform the formulated optimization problem into a convex one and solve it using off-the-shelf solvers. To improve learning performance, we further propose a weight-selection based FL framework. In such a framework, we assign each edge node a proper weight coefficient in model aggregation instead of discarding any of them to reduce the aggregation error, i.e., amplitude alignment of the received local gradient parameters from different edge nodes is not required. We also analyze the performance of this weight-selection based framework and derive an upper bound on its performance loss, followed by minimizing the MSE via optimizing the weight coefficients of the edge nodes, their transmit equalization coefficients, the IRS phase shifts, and the receive factors of the cloud server. Furthermore, we use the MNIST dataset for simulations to evaluate the performance of both node-selection and weight-selection based FL frameworks.

ID ALLOCATION
AB In this article, we present a random access (RA) scheme for federated learning (FL) over massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems to tackle the issue of some local devices not being able to compute their local models. This scheme adopts a multichannel model and allows devices to randomly select their uploading channels, and then the base station (BS) aggregates the local models received from channels directly based on the over-the-air computation. We call this scheme as RA-based FL over massive MIMO (RAFL-MIMO). Furthermore, to enable more devices to be involved in the FL process, we propose to utilize an access class barring (ACB) method to select the uploading devices and formulate an optimization problem of the ACB factor. We also derive the expected asymptotic convergence rate of the proposed RAFL-MIMO scheme to analytically show that the proposed RAFL-MIMO scheme can improve the performance of FL. Simulation results based on L2-norm linear regression, and MNIST handwritten digits identification, Cifar-10 photograph classification show that the proposed RAFL-MIMO scheme significantly outperforms the case of the RAFL-MIMO without the ACB factor.

AB Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) are transforming the global monitoring of road safety. These systems, including vehicular networks and transportation infrastructure, are vulnerable to several security issues, which could disrupt services and potentially cause harm to the users. It is crucial to establish robust security measures to protect against evolving attacks and ensure the safe and reliable operation of ITS. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are mainly used to enhance the security of ITS. The adoption of AI-based techniques to secure ITS against new emerging threats has been limited due to a lack of realistic and recent data on these types of attacks ( $i.e.,$ zero-day attacks). In this context, we introduce a novel Edge-based Framework that uses Federated Learning (FL) and blockchain to secure ITS against new emerging threats. In particular, our proposed framework consists of (1) a novel distributed Edge-based architecture that allows multiple Edge nodes to securely collaborate while preserving their privacy; and (2) a decentralized and secure reputation system based on blockchain technology to maintain the reliability and trustworthiness of the FL process within the ITS; This system manages reputation data for individual nodes (such as vehicles), guaranteeing the integrity of the FL training process. Experiment results using the UNSW-NB15 dataset show that our proposed framework achieves high accuracy and F1 score (99%) in detecting new threats while ensuring the privacy and reliability of the whole ITS. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in securing ITS.

AB The management of network intelligence in Beyond 5G (B5G) networks encompasses the complex challenges of scalability, dynamicity, interoperability, privacy, and security. These are essential steps towards achieving the realization of truly ubiquitous Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based analytics, empowering seamless integration across the entire Continuum (Edge, Fog, Core, Cloud). This paper introduces a Federated Network Intelligence Orchestration approach aimed at scalable and automated Federated Learning (FL)-based anomaly detection in B5G networks. By leveraging a horizontal Federated learning approach based on the FedAvg aggregation algorithm, which employs a deep autoencoder model trained on non-anomalous traffic samples to recognize normal behavior, the system orchestrates network intelligence to detect and prevent cyber-attacks. Integrated into a B5G Zero-touch Service Management (ZSM) aligned Security Framework, the proposal utilizes multi-domain and multi-tenant orchestration to automate and scale the deployment of FL-agents and AI-based anomaly detectors, enhancing reaction capabilities against cyber-attacks. The proposed FL architecture can be dynamically deployed across the B5G Continuum, utilizing a hierarchy of Network Intelligence orchestrators for real-time anomaly and security threat handling. Implementation includes FL enforcement operations for interoperability and extensibility, enabling dynamic deployment, configuration, and reconfiguration on demand. Performance validation of the proposed solution was conducted through dynamic orchestration, FL, and real-time anomaly detection processes using a practical test environment. Analysis of key performance metrics, leveraging the 5G-NIDD dataset, demonstrates the system's capability for automatic and near real-time handling of anomalies and attacks, including real-time network monitoring and countermeasure implementation for mitigation.

AB One common constraint in the practical application of speech recognition is Code Switching. The issue of code-switched languages is especially aggravated in the context of Indian languages - since most massively multilingual models are trained on corpora that are not representative of the diverse set of Indian languages. An associated constraint with such systems is the privacy-intrusive nature of the applications that aim to collate such representative data. To collectively mitigate both problems, this work presents CodeFed: A federated learning-based code-switching detection model that can be deployed to collaboratively be trained by leveraging private data from multiple users, without compromising their privacy. Using a representative lowresource Indic dataset, we demonstrate the superior performance of a collaboratively trained global model that is trained using federated learning on three low-resource Indic languages - Gujarati, Tamil and Telugu and draw a comparison of the model with respect to the most current work in the field. Finally, to evaluate the practical realizability of the proposed system, CodeFed also discusses the system overview of the label generation architecture which may accompany CodeFed's possible real-time deployment.

ID COMMUNICATION
AB Conventional systems are usually constrained to store data in a centralized location. This restriction has either precluded sensitive data from being shared or put its privacy on the line. Alternatively, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm for exchanging model parameters instead of private data of Internet of Things (IoT) devices known as clients. FL trains a global model by communicating local models generated by selected clients throughout many communication rounds until ensuring high learning performance. In these settings, the FL performance highly depends on selecting the best available clients. This process is strongly related to the quality of their models and their training data. Such selection-based schemes have not been explored yet, particularly regarding participating clients having high-quality data yet with limited resources. To address these challenges, we propose in this article FedAUR, a novel approach for an adaptive upgrade of clients resources in FL. We first introduce a method to measure how a locally generated model affects and improves the global model if selected for aggregation without revealing raw data. Next, based on the significance of each client parameters and the resources of their devices, we design a selection scheme that manages and distributes available resources on the server among the appropriate subset of clients. This client selection and resource allocation problem is thus formulated as an optimization problem, where the purpose is to discover and train in each round the maximum number of samples with the highest quality in order to target the desired performance. Moreover, we present a Kubernetes-based prototype that we implemented to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.

AB Federated edge learning (FEEL) emerges as a privacy-preserving paradigm to effectively integrate edge computing for the implementation of deep learning-based vehicular applications. Nevertheless, the incentive mechanism for vehicles participating in varied learning tasks, has not been well explored yet. In this paper, software-defined network (SDN) technology is adopted for the training control among vehicles, and a novel FEEL framework, namely SDN-assisted semi-decentralized FEEL (SSD-FEEL) is investigated, where multiple edge servers collectively coordinate a large number of vehicular models from different learning tasks. By exploiting the low-cost and similar learning tasks among vehicles and edge servers, SSD-FEEL incorporates more training samples, while enjoying the flexibility of edge server assisted model aggregation. Aiming at motivating vehicles to actively participate in training while improving the model accuracy of multiple learning tasks, a joint contract design and task reorganization problem, combined with the evaluation of model convergence and contract performance, is formulated. Then, we propose a two-stage optimization algorithm incorporating iterative reward allocation and task matching, where the model parameters in different tasks are reconstructed according to the matching results with the mobility constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple data sets validate that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher cluster utility and outperform the conventional multi-task FEEL schemes in terms of learning performance.

AB Federated learning (FL) and zero-shot learning have been becoming increasingly popular due to the data-privacy protection and the diagnosis of unseen faults in the industrial fault diagnosis. However, most existing diagnosis methods have the consistency assumption of distributions across different clients under multisource domain scenarios and cannot effectively diagnose both seen and unseen faults. Therefore, to diagnose both seen and unseen faults without data sharing and with distribution discrepancies across different clients, a federated generalized zero-sample fault diagnosis (GZSFD) paradigm is proposed in this article. In the client side, a stacked autoencoder (AE)-based feature extractor is introduced in each client for low-level features. In the cloud server, a feature-level distribution alignment scheme is developed to alleviate discrepancies for more discriminative high-level features. Moreover, a bidirectional AE (BAE) with reconstruction and cross-reconstruction streams is designed to enhance the feature-semantic consistency. Finally, a gating model based on BAE is proposed to identify online samples and mitigates the misclassification of unseen samples. Results on two practical industrial cases show that the proposed method achieves the improvement in federated GZSFD and effectively handles distribution discrepancies across different clients.

AB In this study, to reduce the energy consumption for the federated learning (FL) participation of mobile devices (MDs), we design a novel joint dataset and incentive management mechanism for FL over mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. We formulate a Stackelberg game to model and analyze the behaviors of FL participants, referred to as MDs, and FL service providers, referred to as MECs. In the proposed game, each MEC is the leader, whereas the MDs are followers. As the leader, to maximize its own revenue by considering the trade-off between the cost of providing incentives and the estimated accuracy attained from an FL operation, each MEC provides full incentives to the MDs for the participation of each FL task, as well as the target accuracy level for each MD. The suggested total incentives are allocated over MDs' proportion to the amount of dataset applied for local training, which indirectly affects the global accuracy of the FL. Based on the suggested incentives, the MDs determine the amount of dataset used for the local training of each FL task to maximize their own payoffs, which is defined as the energy consumed from FL participation and the expected incentives. We study the economic benefits of the joint dataset and incentive management mechanism by analyzing its hierarchical decision-making scheme as a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. Using backward induction, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium among MDs, and then examine the Stackelberg equilibrium by analyzing the leader game. We also discuss extensions of the proposed mechanism where the MDs are unaware of explicit information of other MD profiles, such as the weights of the revenue as a practical concern, which can be redesigned into the Stackelberg Bayesian game. Finally, we reveal that the Stackelberg equilibrium solution maximizes the utility of all MDs and the MECs.

AB The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), one of the key technologies for next-generation mobile communication systems, can facilitate data transmission for users all over the world, especially in some remote areas where vast amounts of informative data are collected by Internet of remote things (IoRT) devices to support various data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) services. However, training AI models centrally with the assistance of SAGIN faces the challenges of highly constrained network topology, inefficient data transmission, and privacy issues. To tackle these challenges, we first propose a novel topology-aware federated learning framework for the SAGIN, namely Olive Branch Learning (OBL). Specifically, the IoRT devices in the ground layer leverage their private data to perform model training locally, while the air nodes in the air layer and the ring-structured low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation in the space layer are in charge of model aggregation (synchronization) at different scales. To further enhance communication efficiency and inference performance of OBL, an efficient Communication and Non-IID-aware Air node-Satellite Assignment (CNASA) algorithm is designed by taking the data class distribution of the air nodes as well as their geographic locations into account. Furthermore, we extend our OBL framework and CNASA algorithm to adapt to more complex multi-orbit satellite networks. We analyze the convergence of our OBL framework and conclude that the CNASA algorithm contributes to the fast convergence of the global model. Extensive experiments based on realistic datasets corroborate the superior performance of our algorithm over the benchmark policies.

TI Heterogeneous Workload-Based Consumer Resource Recommendation Model for

   computing; edge computing; resource recommendation
AB Over the past decade, there has been a significant surge in consumer application services and server connectivity, and this trend is expected to double in 2030. The primary contributors to the increased demand for network resources are devices connected through third-party service providers and mobile operators. Many prominent consumer services rely on a client-server architecture, which can introduce latency delays in the communication channel. Additionally, peer-to-peer (P2P) communication places a substantial load on eHealth servers, leading to service delays. In this research paper, we propose a model for scheduling heterogeneous workloads and recommending resources for eHealth edge-cloud connectivity using Federated Split Learning (FSL) model for smart cities. Distributed FSL offers a robust solution for handling both direct and indirect user requests through a distributed mobile core operator stack. This technique empowers eHealth administrators to locally learn optimal policies and make informed decisions by prioritizing resource allocation and scheduling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique through an active simulation server designed for track-driven caching policy and local policy scheduling, ultimately enhancing resource recommendation in eHealth applications. The proposed technique is focused on the development of a heterogeneous workload recommendation system and obtained accuracy of 89.63% over 200 users trails.

AB Federated learning (FL), utilizing data from the edge devices (EDs) while protecting user privacy has gained much attention. Its efficacy is substantially influenced by both the quantity of connected devices and the quality of wireless communications. Network congestion, resulting from multiple access and signal attenuation caused by physical obstacles may severely impact the convergence of the FL model. To address these issues, this article employs nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for uplink transmission and designs a two-tier FL framework consisting of ground devices and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to ensure the construction of Line of Sight (LoS) channels from EDs to the base station. Moreover, we construct a multiobjective joint optimization problem to minimize the FL convergence time considering constraints, such as the NOMA uplink latency, ED selection strategy, local training latency, and energy consumption. We also deduce the theoretical upper bound of the convergence time and transform the proposed multiobjective problem into a solvable form by eliminating the discrete variables determined by the ED selection. In turn, we utilize the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to solve this optimization problem. Finally, the extensive experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed algorithm in terms of latency and energy consumption, while yielding a high robustness and scalability.

AB With the rapid development of consumer electronics and communication technology, a large amount of data is generated from end users at the edge of the networks. Modern recommendation systems take full advantage of such data for training their various artificial intelligence (AI) models. However, traditional centralized model training has to transmit all the data to the cloud-based servers, which suffers from privacy leakage and resource shortage. Therefore, mobile edge computing (MEC) combined with federated learning (FL) is considered as a promising paradigm to address these issues. The smart devices can provide data and computing resources for the FL and transmit the local model parameters to the base station (BS) equipped with edge servers to aggregate into a global model. Nevertheless, due to the limited physical resources and the risk of privacy leakage, the users (the owners of the devices) would not like to participate in FL voluntarily. To address this issue, we take advantage of game theory to propose an incentive mechanism based on the two-stage Stackelberg game to inspire users to contribute computing resources for FL. We define two utility functions for the users and the BS, and formulate the utility maximization problem. Through theoretical analysis, we obtain the Nash equilibrium strategy of the users and the Stackelberg equilibrium of the utility maximization problem. Furthermore, we propose a game-based incentive mechanism algorithm (GIMA) to achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the performance of our GIMA algorithm. The experimental results show that our GIMA algorithm converges quickly, and can achieve higher utility value compared to other incentive methods.

AB In federated learning (FL), model training is distributed over clients and local models are aggregated by a central server. The performance of uploaded models in such situations can vary widely due to imbalanced data distributions, potential demands on privacy protections, and quality of transmissions. In this paper, we aim to minimize FL training delay over wireless channels, constrained by overall training performance as well as each client's differential privacy (DP) requirement. We solve this problem in a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MAMAB) framework to deal with the situation where there are multiple clients confronting different unknown transmission environments, e.g., channel fading and interference. Specifically, we first transform long-term constraints on both training performance and each client's DP into a virtual queue based on the Lyapunov drift technique. Then, we convert the MAMAB to a max-min bipartite matching problem at each communication round, by estimating rewards with the upper confidence bound (UCB) approach. More importantly, we propose two efficient solutions to this matching problem, i.e., a modified Hungarian algorithm and greedy matching with a better alternative (GMBA), of which the former can achieve the optimal solution with high complexity while the latter approaches a better trade-off by enabling verified low-complexity with little performance loss. In addition, we develop an upper bound on the expected regret of this MAMAB based FL framework, which shows a linear growth over the logarithm of communication rounds, justifying its theoretical feasibility. Extensive experimental results are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, and the impacts of various parameters on the FL performance over wireless edge networks are also discussed.

AB With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and industrial technology, Industrial Internet has become an emerging research field. Due to the industrial specialty, higher requirements are put forward for time delay, safety, and stability of the identification analysis service. The traditional domain name system (DNS) cannot meet the requirements of industrial Internet because of the single form of identification subject and weak awareness of security protection. As a solution, this work applies blockchain and federated learning (FL) to the industrial Internet identification. Blockchain is a decentralized infrastructure widely used in digital encrypted currencies such as Bitcoin, which can make secure data storage and access possible. Federated learning protects terminal personal data privacy and can carry out efficient machine learning among multiple participants. The numerical results justify that our proposed federated learning and blockchain combination lays a strong foundation for the development of future industrial Internet.

AB Machine learning's exponential growth has transformed healthcare, with Federated Learning (FL) playing a pivotal role. Despite its significance, FL is vulnerable to privacy attacks. In response, researchers have integrated differential privacy (DP) into FL. Nevertheless, incorporating DP introduces challenges such as increased total communication costs and computational overheads due to the introduction of noise. This drawback renders FL with DP less viable for healthcare systems, characterized by numerous low-resource devices and network bandwidth constraints. To overcome this limitation, we propose integrating a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) aggregator post-noise addition to transform the gradient generated by local training before sending it to the central server. This process reduces the gradient size and provides rudimentary encryption. The evaluation results reveal the superior performance of our proposed method, demonstrating an enhanced accuracy ranging from 0.2% to 2% compared to existing differential privacy techniques, including RDP, DP-SGD, ZcDP, LDP-Fed, and DP-AdapClip. Our approach substantially reduces the total communication costs (ranging from 6% to 43% across different privacy budgets) with faster training times in healthcare datasets such as the PIMA Indian database and Breast Cancer Histopathology Images.

AB The emergence of edge computing guarantees the combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). The vertical federated learning (VFL) framework, usually deployed by split learning, can analyze and integrate information on different features collected by different terminals in the IoT. The complete model is divided into a top model and multiple bottom models in a specific middle layer. Each passive party as a terminal with certain features owns a bottom model, and an active party as an edge server with labels holds the top model. Feature inference attack aims to infer the party's features from the model predictions during prediction in VFL. Existing attacks considered the adversary an active party under the white-box or black-box model. However, an attacker usually is a passive party in practice because terminals are more vulnerable than edge servers. Therefore, this article discusses a practical feature inference attack in VFL during prediction in IoT under this setting. We design an adversary builds an inference model to minimize the distance between the predictions from the inferred features and target features. Because the information on the top model and other bottom models is unknown, the adversary cannot directly train the inference model. Therefore, we utilize the zeroth-order gradient estimation method to calculate the parameters' gradients to train the inference model. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our attack is comparable to that of the white-box attacks while retaining apparent advantages over the existing black-box attacks.

AB Coupled with the rise of Deep Learning, the wealth of data and enhanced computation capabilities of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components enable effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models to be built. Beyond ground data sources, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based service providers for data collection and AI model training, i.e., Drones-as-a-Service (DaaS), is becoming increasingly popular in recent years. However, the stringent regulations governing data privacy potentially impedes data sharing across independently owned UAVs. To this end, we propose the adoption of a Federated Learning (FL) based approach to enable privacy-preserving collaborative Machine Learning across a federation of independent DaaS providers for the development of IoV applications, e.g., for traffic prediction and car park occupancy management. Given the information asymmetry and incentive mismatches between the UAVs and model owners, we leverage on the self-revealing properties of a multi-dimensional contract to ensure truthful reporting of the UAV types, while accounting for the multiple sources of heterogeneity, e.g., in sensing, computation, and transmission costs. Then, we adopt the Gale-Shapley algorithm to match the lowest cost UAV to each subregion. The simulation results validate the incentive compatibility of our contract design, and shows the efficiency of our matching, thus guaranteeing profit maximization for the model owner amid information asymmetry.

AB Monitoring construction site safety through physical observations is inherently flawed due to the complex and dynamic nature of construction sites. To overcome these challenges and enhance worker safety management, decentralized model training-assisted edge intelligence emerges as a promising solution. However, despite the potential benefits, our investigation reveals that no research for worker safety prediction has been grounded in the Federated Learning (FL) approach. In this context, we present a novel approach to worker safety prediction, leveraging FL in outdoor construction environments while preserving the privacy and security of sensitive data. Our methodology involves deploying sensor-based IoT devices at construction sites to collect highly granular spatial and temporal weather, building, and worker data. This data is then collaboratively utilized for training Deep Neural Network (DNN) models on the edge nodes in a cross-silos manner. To implement our approach, we establish a test-bed utilizing the EdgeX framework and constrained devices such as Raspberry Pi 4Bs, acting as edge nodes. Following the collaborative training, the resultant global model is deployed on participating nodes for edge inference, ensuring optimal network resource utilization and data privacy. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in improving the utilization of construction safety management systems and reducing the risk of accidents and fatalities in the future. The outcome is a system that exhibits enhanced speed and responsiveness, a crucial aspect for time-sensitive applications such as the prediction of worker safety.

AB Federated learning ensures the privacy of fault diagnosis by maintaining a decentralized and local training data approach, eliminating the need to share confidential information with a central server. However, the performance of trained models tends to significantly deteriorate when applied to completely unseen domains. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel method called federated domain generalization with a global robust model aggregation strategy. Our proposed method can collaboratively train a model with outstanding generalization ability and robustness to unseen target domains in a data-protecting way. Specifically, a maximum mean discrepancy is introduced in the central server to reduce the discrepancy of features from different source clients. Meanwhile, classification loss across source domains is designed as the weights for local model aggregation in the central server. Finally, experimental results under two different bearing fault datasets show that our method obtains higher classification accuracy than other compared methods, which demonstrates that the proposed method has better generalization ability and is promising in real industrial applications.

AB Federated learning (FL) activates distributed on-device computation techniques to model a better algorithm performance with the interaction of local model updates and global model distributions in aggregation averaging processes. However, in large-scale heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) cellular networks, massive multi-dimensional model update iterations and resource-constrained computation are challenging aspects to be tackled significantly. This paper introduces the system model of converging software defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) to enable device/resource abstractions and provide NFV-enabled edge FL (eFL) aggregation servers for advancing automation and controllability. Multi-agent deep Q-networks (MADQNs) target to enforce a self-learning softwarization, optimize resource allocation policies, and advocate computation offloading decisions. With gathered network conditions and resource states, the proposed agent aims to explore various actions for estimating expected longterm rewards in a particular state observation. In exploration phase, optimal actions for joint resource allocation and offloading decisions in different possible states are obtained by maximum Q-value selections. Action-based virtual network functions (VNF) forwarding graph (VNFFG) is orchestrated to map VNFs towards eFL aggregation server with sufficient communication and computation resources in NFV infrastructure (NFVI). The proposed scheme indicates deficient allocation actions, modifies the VNF backup instances, and reallocates the virtual resource for exploitation phase. Deep neural network (DNN) is used as a value function approximator, and epsilon greedy algorithm balances exploration and exploitation. The scheme primarily considers the criticalities of FL model services and congestion states to optimize long-term policy. Simulation results presented the outperformance of the proposed scheme over reference schemes in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) performance metrics, including packet drop ratio, packet drop counts, packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput.

AB We are interested in estimating the effect of a treatment applied to individuals at multiple sites, where data is stored locally for each site. Due to privacy constraints, individual-level data cannot be shared across sites; the sites may also have heterogeneous populations and treatment assignment mechanisms. Motivated by these considerations, we develop federated methods to draw inferences on the average treatment effects of combined data across sites. Our methods first compute summary statistics locally using propensity scores and then aggregate these statistics across sites to obtain point and variance estimators of average treatment effects. We show that these estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. To achieve these asymptotic properties, we find that the aggregation schemes need to account for the heterogeneity in treatment assignments and in outcomes across sites. We demonstrate the validity of our federated methods through a comparative study of two large medical claims databases.
